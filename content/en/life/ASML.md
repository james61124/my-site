Going abroad for an internship was probably the biggest but also the most successful decision I have ever made in my life. Spending six months exploring the world outside was an incredible experience, and even now, looking back, it still feels surreal. Returning to Taiwan afterward felt somewhat unreal. Here, I want to share the bits and pieces of these six months.

### üî• **Why Choose the ASML Netherlands Headquarters Internship Program?**

This program is a collaboration between National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) and ASML, allowing students to intern at ASML headquarters in the Netherlands for six months. First and foremost, I am very grateful to my university for providing this opportunity. I believe it is an extremely worthwhile program‚Äîgetting paid while traveling abroad for half a year. Even though I had to sacrifice my graduate school application results, I still decided to go without hesitation.

### üè¢ **Stepping into a Tech Giant: ASML Headquarters‚Äô Environment and Culture**

#### üìç **Work Location: Veldhoven, Netherlands**

ASML‚Äôs headquarters is located in Veldhoven, a small town next to Eindhoven. When introducing my location to others, I usually just say Eindhoven because it is a more well-known city, especially for flight transfers within Europe.

Veldhoven is a very quiet and comfortable town, mostly residential. The advantages are that it is peaceful and extremely safe‚Äîno typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes, political instability, or public safety concerns. However, the convenience is nowhere near Taiwan‚Äôs level. The nearest supermarket is about a kilometer away, the closest train station is eight kilometers away by bike, and there are no convenience stores or 24-hour shops for late-night snacks.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Work-Life BalanceÔºü**

One of the biggest differences between Europe and Taiwan is the pace of life. The true meaning of "off work = off work" was one of the biggest cultural shocks for me. Work-life balance is highly emphasized here. Many Taiwanese engineers who came for short-term business trips also mentioned this. By around 4 PM, if people feel they have completed their tasks for the day, they start heading home. Additionally, employees can work from home two days a week, so on Fridays, most of the team is absent.

Another surprising thing was how mentors and colleagues stressed that once off work, you should not check work messages or emails. In Taiwan, it‚Äôs common to be called in for work late at night. Also, during summer, it‚Äôs not unusual for your partner or manager to disappear for one or two weeks on vacation, leaving you entirely on your own.

### üåç **A Melting Pot of Cultures: Team Members from Around the World**

Although this is the Dutch headquarters, the proportion of Dutch employees is not particularly high. In my team, the group leader was Italian, the project leader had dual Turkish and Belgian nationalities, and the remaining members included a Brazilian, a Chinese, and only one Dutch colleague. During various events, I also met people from Indonesia, Croatia, and other countries. It was truly a multicultural environment.

English is the primary language here due to the diverse backgrounds of employees. One interesting phenomenon is that, for example, Belgian and Dutch colleagues speak Dutch with each other, but as soon as I join the conversation, they automatically switch to English. Everyone is very considerate. However, adapting to the speed of their English conversations was challenging. Topics often revolved around investments, real estate, taxes, or company gossip‚Äîsubjects that, even in Chinese, I might struggle to engage in. Over time, I gradually learned when and how to participate in conversations.

### üíª **What Did I Do at ASML?**

My title was Competence Engineer in the CS department. Competence Engineers mainly handle issues that the local team cannot resolve and escalate to the headquarters for structural solutions. Unfortunately, in my first month, I was refining a real-time auto-monitoring tool. Due to limitations in ASML‚Äôs existing dashboard, the local team needed a real-time monitoring tool to instantly detect machine anomalies and send notifications via Microsoft Teams chat. Otherwise, the dashboard might take up to two days to reflect a bug. I had already developed a demo version, but then Microsoft updated its chat API, deprecating the old one, while ASML blocked the new API. After long discussions with colleagues, we ultimately had to abandon the project, which was quite disappointing.

Fortunately, my mentor quickly assigned me to another project. Competence Engineers evaluate various indicators of an issue, while project leaders prioritize and assign them to different departments. However, there was no integrated platform to consolidate and analyze these issues efficiently, so my work later focused on creating a visualization and data analysis platform for this purpose.

Besides work, ASML offers many clubs. I joined the badminton club and met people from all over the world.

### üè° **Experiencing Life in Europe**

Since food is quite expensive here, I usually cook at home after work, except for occasional gatherings. Eating out costs around ‚Ç¨10‚Äì15 per meal on average, while cooking at home brings it down to about ‚Ç¨4‚Äì5 per meal, allowing me to save some budget for weekend trips.

Beyond food, many aspects of daily life here are quite different from Taiwan. For example, there are no garbage trucks. Instead, every household has a large waste bin, similar to a dumpster with a lid. After sorting the trash, you simply throw it in, and a designated team comes to collect it each week. The recycling system is also different from Taiwan‚Äôs. Items like plastic bags, milk cartons, and plastic containers‚Äîthings I used to consider regular trash‚Äîmust be disposed of as plastic waste as long as they contain any plastic material.

People here also love sunbathing. Since daylight hours are so short in winter, many people leave for work before sunrise and return home after sunset, barely seeing any sunlight throughout the day. So when summer arrives, they cherish every bit of sunshine. However, the weather here changes drastically‚Äîit could be 30¬∞C and sunny one day, then suddenly drop to 17‚Äì18¬∞C the next. Or, you might wake up to bright sunshine in the morning, only to get caught in a heavy downpour later in the day.

### üí° **What Have I Learned in the Past Six Months?**

For a Taiwanese person, the length of daylight here is probably the coolest thing. In Taiwan, although we know that summer days are longer and winter days are shorter, the difference isn‚Äôt that significant. However, Eindhoven is at a higher latitude than even the northernmost part of Japan. When we first arrived, it was still bright outside at 10 PM, so we could walk around freely at night. But by winter, the sun would set as early as 4 or 5 PM. The biggest shift comes with the daylight saving time adjustment. At the end of October, the time zone changes from GMT+2 to GMT+1, which means clocks are set back one hour‚Äîwhat was previously 5 PM becomes 4 PM. The transition happens at 2 AM, when the clock repeats the hour, so we get an extra hour of sleep that night. From that day on, the shortening daylight hours become very noticeable. One day, it gets dark around 7 PM, and the next, the sun starts setting at 5 or 6 PM‚Äîcompletely catching us off guard.

The Netherlands feels much safer than Taiwan, though I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just an illusion. Every European country has its own unique characteristics, and the Netherlands strikes me as the most pragmatic and free-spirited one. It‚Äôs relatively safe here‚Äîaside from the risk of having your bike stolen, there aren‚Äôt many pickpockets or gangsters roaming the streets. Walking around, I feel completely at ease. Another reason this place is so livable is that there are hardly any natural disasters‚Äîno earthquakes, typhoons, volcanoes, or wars. It‚Äôs a place where you're born into retirement‚Äîcalm and carefree.

To save money, we bought bicycles, but riding from our rental place to Eindhoven Central was an 8-kilometer journey. We went out almost every weekend, which meant cycling this long distance regularly. At the time, it felt exhausting‚Äîpartly because it was so far, and partly because our second-hand bikes weren‚Äôt in the best condition. But looking back, it was actually a lot of fun.

If I could be reborn, Europe would be a great place to live. The taxes are high, but the social benefits are excellent. You could say that since all the money goes to the government, they take care of everything for you. A native European doesn‚Äôt have to worry about much or save a ton of money‚Äîeach stage of life comes with strong social support. However, for someone only staying temporarily, the appeal is a bit different. It‚Äôs a great place to live and travel, but not the best place to save money. The taxes are high, and so is the cost of living. Unless you plan to stay long-term or just want to enjoy life, it‚Äôs not the best place to build up savings.

Even though I came here for work, it honestly felt more like an exchange program. My main goal was figuring out how to travel to all the important places on the lowest possible budget. This trip has had a huge impact on me. Our landlord once said something that really stuck with me: ‚ÄúLife isn‚Äôt just about making and saving money; you also need to know how to spend it.‚Äù In Taiwan, we‚Äôre often taught to focus on saving, but not on how to enjoy life. Traveling teaches you so much‚Äîreading thousands of books isn‚Äôt as good as walking thousands of miles. This experience has given me a fresh perspective on that saying.

Of course, this leads to another issue‚Äîyou can only learn how to spend money wisely if you actually have money to spend. Instead of relying on "other people" to provide us with a lot of money, sometimes we need to step outside our comfort zones, identify what we lack, and work on improving ourselves. Those improvements become our assets.

These past six months have been incredibly fulfilling. Apart from occasionally needing to rest after long trips, we traveled internationally almost every weekend. In total, I visited 18 countries and dozens of cities, greatly expanding my horizons. After finishing my internship, I also planned a month-long Europe tour before returning to Taiwan. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be back in Europe again, but everything I‚Äôve experienced and everyone I‚Äôve met here has had a profound impact on my life. I can only say‚ÄîI‚Äôm truly grateful for the decision I made back then.
