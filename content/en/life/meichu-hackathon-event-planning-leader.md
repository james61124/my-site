The Mei-Chu Hackathon is the largest student-run hackathon in Taiwan. Let me first briefly introduce what a hackathon is: the term combines "Hack" and "Marathon." During the competition, participants are required to complete a project within a very short timeframe, from idea generation to actual implementation. This makes it a highly challenging event. As part of the organizing team, our goal is to ensure the smooth running of the event while addressing past issues and introducing new innovations to make the event better every year.

## **About the Mei-Chu Hackathon Organizing Team**

The team consists of over 40 members, divided into seven departments: Administration, Public Relations, Marketing, Finance, Event Planning, Development, and Design. Each department is led by 2-3 heads and has 5-6 members under them.


## **Why I Chose to be the Head of the Event Planning Department**

The Mei-Chu Hackathon organizing team is highly selective, with an annual acceptance rate of only around 10%. In the first year, selected members join as team members, and in the second year, department heads are chosen from this pool. So essentially, we’ve had experience organizing two consecutive events.

I was initially drawn to the event because it aligns closely with my academic background, and I wanted to learn and grow within a well-structured team. The experience of organizing a large-scale event is invaluable to me. Prior to this, I had few opportunities to engage in public affairs. The Mei-Chu Hackathon covers a broad range of responsibilities: the team has over 40 members, there are over 300 participants, and we collaborate with dozens of partner and sponsor companies, with an annual budget approaching 2 million NTD. Being involved in an event of this scale and leading a department was a great growth opportunity for me.

## **Event Planning Department Responsibilities**

Our department handles everything related to the venue and event process. Below are some of our key tasks.

### **Venue Rental**

Since our main audience consists of students from NCTU and NTHU, and because the event requires an overnight venue, we aimed to secure either NCTU or NTHU gymnasiums. This was a long process because neither gym allows overnight events. The schools require staff to be on-site during nighttime hours to ensure safety, which was a significant hurdle. Additionally, our setup times often clashed with team practices and PE classes, making scheduling a challenge.

### **Venue Setup**

Given the extensive equipment needed for the event, we partnered with "Activity King Group," a company specializing in event logistics. They handled everything related to venue setup and equipment. The process involved six months of adjustments, covering details like table and chair arrangements, stage setup, sound and lighting systems, vendor booths, generator setups, power distribution, and internet access. These details were fine-tuned step by step.

### **Meal Distribution**

Our department was also responsible for providing meals at the venue. Estimating the right amount of food was challenging; we had to account for potential shortages and sometimes had to place emergency orders if vendors didn’t deliver enough.

### **Detailed Event Schedule Planning**

This was the most challenging aspect. The Event Planning Department had to ensure that every staff member knew their tasks at every point in time and understood where the event was in its schedule. We designed an efficient schedule, allocated manpower appropriately, and created a user-friendly format for everyone to follow. As the event drew closer, more details needed to be finalized, leading to sleepless nights in the final week as we worried about every aspect of the schedule.

### **Entertainment and Corporate Expo**

This section was primarily handled by team members. One unique aspect of the Mei-Chu Hackathon is that, in addition to corporate booths, we have entertainment areas for participants, featuring different types of game machines each year. Past attractions included massage chairs, Logitech racing simulators, ball pits, and more. The Event Planning Department also designed prize draws and activities to encourage participants to visit corporate booths, often integrating these with a LINE bot for engaging challenges.

### **On-Site Coordination**

The final test for the Event Planning Department heads was managing on-site operations. No matter how detailed the schedule was, unexpected issues always arose on the day of the event. We had to ensure every team member was in the right place at the right time. On the day of the event, you’d see three of us constantly running around with earpieces, coordinating and troubleshooting. We faced a significant challenge when our Admin Lead tested positive for COVID-19 on the day, leaving us without a crucial team member. We had to scramble to fill that gap.


## **Reflections from the Past Year**

First, I want to express how fortunate we were to have a highly capable and creative administration team. They led us through the event planning process and solved many of the issues that plagued previous years. Large organizations often face management challenges, such as complex communication and document organization across departments. Without proper document categorization, version discrepancies and information gaps easily arise. This event showed us how even minor delays in one department’s tasks can cascade and affect other teams.

Every department had its periods of intense pressure. For the Event Planning Department, stress peaked as the event date approached, when we had to handle numerous unexpected issues. I must admit, I’m not great with details, so I’m grateful to the other two department heads for their hard work and support during the preparation phase, which taught me a lot. When I was younger, large events seemed like a mystery to me—I never knew how things operated behind the scenes. Participating in this process opened my eyes; I learned about event workflows, venue setups, manpower allocation, and so much more. It’s an entirely different experience from merely attending an event.

The pressure on-site was intense since we were responsible for the entire event’s rhythm. We had to make quick decisions when delays occurred, ensure equipment and manpower were in place, and handle emergencies. One of the most dramatic incidents this year was when a participant experienced heart palpitations during the competition, and we had to call an ambulance to take them to the hospital, which shocked everyone. While we did our best to keep everything running smoothly, there were inevitably some gaps. One member kept complaining about issues we hadn’t addressed, which was disheartening since everyone was doing their best. Constructive feedback is welcome, but delivering it with frustration or anger creates unnecessary tension.

This year has been incredibly rewarding. Beyond learning event management details, I met many capable people from different fields, people I wouldn’t have encountered within my usual circles. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone during college, whether by joining new activities or trying things you usually wouldn’t. I’m glad I seized this opportunity, which added fresh memories to my sophomore and junior years.
