I was the president of the NCTU Guitar Club. My sophomore year in the club was more than just enjoying university life and making new friends; it was an important life experience and a serious dedication to music.

## **Why I Wanted to Become President**

There were two key reasons: developing leadership skills and my passion for music.

I’ve always believed that university is a time when you can afford to take risks. It’s a period with a high tolerance for making mistakes, allowing us to step out of our comfort zones and face unknown challenges. Life is like a journey—you can’t stay at the inn forever. The challenges in university are worth attempting because the consequences of failure at this stage are usually not too severe. On the contrary, these challenges often become valuable growth experiences. Of course, it’s essential to consider your capacity before taking on these challenges, as taking responsibility for them is crucial.

Running for the president position was a fitting challenge for me. I could learn how to organize events, manage different departments, operate and promote a club, balance event quality and workload, and handle conflicts among officers. Leading a club that I’m passionate about in a field I love was a great opportunity.

With 14 years of piano experience and 8 years with the guitar, I’ve been deeply involved in music for over a decade. Music has become an indispensable part of my life, helping me navigate various pressures and introducing me to many like-minded friends. As president, my goal was to unite everyone who loves music and create more performance opportunities while continuing to grow on my musical journey.

## **Key Club Activities**

### **Welcome Party**

This is the first performance that freshmen experience before joining the club. It’s a performance that kicks off the year’s club activities, so the quality is essential. The content and quality of the performance largely determine the number of members who will participate throughout the semester. I was quite nervous at the time since it was our first time working together as a team. Many of us were performing together for the first time, and we had to face a large audience. In the end, nearly 200 people attended the event, and everything went smoothly. Although some performers were a bit nervous, it was a great start.

### **Freshman Stage**

This internal performance is not open to the public and is primarily for freshmen to showcase their talents. The main purpose is to provide an opportunity for newcomers to perform since later performances, which are open to the public, have higher quality expectations and can be intimidating for beginners. This event helps build confidence and strengthen connections within the club.

### **Winter and Spring Cottage Performances**

Commonly known as “Winter Cottage” and “Spring Cottage,” these are the most well-known performances of the Guitar Club, held once each semester. The performances take place at the small cottage on campus, hence the name. During these events, a crowd usually gathers to enjoy music while eating waffles. However, the university often disapproves of this venue, citing noise complaints from nearby buildings, but we still manage to get approval every year.

### **End-of-Semester Performance**

This is the culmination of the first semester’s efforts, but it always faces a challenge: the performance date inevitably conflicts with final exams for many departments, leading to a significant drop in attendance. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a fundamental solution, so we focused on increasing visibility through better promotion and careful scheduling (like having freshmen perform first to attract their friends and family). Despite these challenges, we were fortunate that the event went well.

### **Member Gathering - BBQ Party**

Traditionally, this event didn’t exist, but after observing the club for a semester, I realized that cohesion within the group isn’t solely dependent on members’ skill levels. We needed to spend more time strengthening bonds within the club. With increased unity, activities naturally become more enjoyable and attract more participation. So, I decided to host this event to enhance the club’s sense of community. Although it wasn’t perfectly organized as a first-time event, it achieved its purpose. I’m happy to see that future cohorts have continued and improved upon this tradition.

### **Folk Night**

This was supposed to be the main event of the year, but sadly, due to the pandemic, all large-scale events were canceled by the university. It was disappointing since we had already done substantial preparation. We had to return all our sponsorships, discard all promotional materials, and cancel all rehearsals. Although I felt sorry for everyone, it was something beyond our control. Despite not having a proper conclusion to the year, looking back, I’m grateful for the many memorable experiences—meeting amazing people, organizing performances, and working to improve the club.



## **Reflections on My Leadership Experience**

Leading a team is truly an area where you constantly learn. Throughout the year, I found myself swinging between various choices and compromises. The most important lesson I learned is that it’s impossible to make decisions that satisfy everyone. I once heard a quote I really like: “A good decision-maker is someone who can make the best and quickest decisions.” This may sound like a cliché, but it highlights a real dilemma. The reason you can’t make a quick decision is often because it seems like no matter what you choose, someone or something will be affected. You need to understand what’s most important for your team and learn to prioritize by sacrificing less critical aspects.

Reflecting on my performance throughout the year, I feel that my decisions were too “soft.” Being “soft” means that while maintaining event quality, you inevitably sacrifice your own time and that of the officers. Good event quality requires extensive preparation. NCTU isn’t a university known for strong club culture since it’s more academically focused. Motivating the team to make sacrifices for club activities was a significant challenge. I couldn’t guarantee success in their academic lives, so I hesitated to push them too hard, which led to two outcomes: a slight compromise in event quality and burning myself out.

Regarding the perspective of a leader, it’s crucial to see the bigger picture and effectively use available resources. I think a fitting way to describe it is: “You don’t need to complete every task yourself, but you must ensure that every task is completed.” This is a different mindset from that of a regular officer, who only needs to complete assigned tasks. A leader must ensure that once tasks are delegated, the event can proceed smoothly. Can they complete the tasks? If unexpected issues arise, are there backup plans? To address these questions, you need to invest more effort in thinking through the details. This brings us to another balancing act: deciding which details are worth focusing on and which are not. If you focus on every detail, meetings become extremely long. But if you delegate and let go entirely, something is bound to go wrong. It’s essential to ensure that meetings efficiently cover the key points while each team tracks their progress.

In conclusion, my sophomore year brought significant changes to my life. I used to focus only on matters directly related to me, but my experience in the club taught me to see the world from a broader perspective. It also instilled in me the pressure of responsibility. Therefore, I believe that during university, it’s essential to pursue learning not only through academic achievements but also by gaining other important values from different experiences that broaden your horizons.
