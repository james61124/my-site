## **Day 1**

My first solo trip was to Europe, and the moment I got off the plane, everything felt new. Standing in a foreign city, surrounded by an unfamiliar environment and language, the word "unknown" defined our entire journey. No matter how well-prepared we were, exploring a new country and culture always brings unexpected surprises and insights. The main takeaway from this trip was experiencing these cities firsthand, not just for the attractions, but also for their overall atmosphere and culture.

### **Arc de Triomphe**

The Arc de Triomphe was even more imposing than it looks in photos, especially with its commanding presence at the center of a massive roundabout. Climbing the 200 steps to the top offers a stunning view of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower as a breathtaking backdrop. The Arc is at the hub of 12 radiating roads, and because we visited during rush hour, the roundabout was completely clogged with traffic, disrupting the flow of all the connecting avenues. Standing at the top, we could hear endless honking, and the sheer scale of the traffic jam was oddly impressive, reflecting the frustration of those stuck in it.

### **Seine River**

People often say the Seine is a romantic river, and a river cruise is a must-do activity. The cruise offers views of many famous Paris landmarks while you enjoy the cool breeze on the deck and take in the cityscape. It’s a relaxing experience, though in hindsight, I might have chosen to visit another attraction instead. The fleeting glimpses of these sights from the boat didn’t leave a strong impression, and while Paris is indeed beautiful from the river, I found myself more curious about why the river’s flow was so fast than fully enjoying the cruise.

### **Cuisine**

![Le-Petit-Cler](/images/posts/paris-20240125/Le-Petit-Cler.jpg)

Our first meal was at Le Petit Cler, where we tried duck confit and escargot—must-try dishes according to our pre-trip research. I don’t mind European cuisine, even though my taste might be considered simple, but I can see how it could be a bit unfamiliar for many Taiwanese people. Escargot tastes similar to large snails, with the key flavor coming from the sauce. The duck confit reminded us of chicken legs—we even questioned if we’d ordered the right dish—but I think it’s a flavor that would appeal to many in Taiwan.

![L-Eclipse](/images/posts/paris-20240125/L-Eclipse.jpg)

L’Eclipse was a small restaurant near where we stayed, run by a very friendly owner who chatted with us every day. It’s also where we had the most memorable dish of the trip—a cheese platter. The reason we ordered it was because a French person I met on the plane highly recommended trying cheese in Paris, so we thought we’d give it a shot. I’d say everyone should try it at least once, not because it’s bad, but because having such a large quantity of cheese can be overwhelming for those of us who are used to just a single slice. But I must say, they really do have a wide variety of cheeses. By the way, this was also where we learned that in French restaurants, the bread served before the meal is free and can be refilled, much like how bread is treated as a staple food there.

### **Daily Summary**

Paris has some interesting contrasts. While the metro is a bit outdated, the streets are very clean, with trash bins frequently available but never overflowing. Every waiter hums a tune while taking orders, radiating positive energy. It feels like they truly enjoy their work, seamlessly blending life with their jobs. On the other hand, no one seems to care much about pedestrian lights, and seeing mice in restaurants seems to be a common sight that doesn’t bother anyone.



## **Day 2**

### **Sainte Chapelle**

![Sainte-Chapelle](/images/posts/paris-20240125/Sainte-Chapelle.jpg)

The highlight of Sainte Chapelle is its massive rose window and 15 stained-glass panels, each depicting different biblical stories in 1,113 individual sections. Although I’m not a Christian and didn’t understand most of the stories, the grandeur is undeniable. Each small piece of glass tells an independent story, and together they form an immersive Christian world—a sweeping narrative that unfolds before you as you take it all in.

### **La Conciergerie**

![La-Conciergerie](/images/posts/paris-20240125/La-Conciergerie.jpg)

La Conciergerie is a smaller attraction, once a prison that held over 2,600 people. Many of the original features are gone, leaving just key spaces and some old tools. However, the free AR guide more than makes up for it, showing what the rooms once looked like and how they were used. This visual storytelling, complete with well-designed animations, transformed the visit from a bland walkthrough into a highly engaging experience.

### **Musée du Louvre**

![Musée-du-Louvre](/images/posts/paris-20240125/Musée-du-Louvre.jpg)

The Louvre was one of the main highlights of our trip to France, and I had been eagerly anticipating it. The glass pyramid exudes modern elegance, so much so that I bought a miniature version as a souvenir. Since we’re not particularly well-versed in art, we focused on visiting a few key exhibits—the museum’s three treasures: the Venus de Milo, the Mona Lisa, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

#### **La Joconde**

![La-Joconde](/images/posts/paris-20240125/La-Joconde.jpg)

As soon as we entered the Louvre, we headed straight for the Mona Lisa—it’s the only artwork we were familiar with before visiting. There’s a legend that no matter where you stand, the Mona Lisa’s eyes will follow you, and to my surprise, it’s true! It’s a strange sensation, as if the painting’s gaze meets yours no matter where you move. The painting exudes an aura of ambiguity—her smile, her expression, everything is deliberately vague. Even more astonishing is that this famous piece is an unfinished work. The legend of the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile truly lives up to its reputation.

#### **Victoire de Samothrace**

We actually passed by this statue on our way to the Mona Lisa without realizing it was one of the museum’s treasures. We later came back to admire it more closely. After seeing so many statues, you start to notice that despite all being sculptures, each one conveys a distinct artistic expression. Some are soft and gentle, while others are fierce or grand. The Winged Victory’s dynamic pose gives off a sense of power and conquest, as if she’s ready to take on the world. Even though her head is missing, the sheer force of her presence is undeniable.

#### **Vénus de Milo**

![Vénus-de-Milo](/images/posts/paris-20240125/Vénus-de-Milo.jpg)

The Venus de Milo was already missing its arms when it was discovered, but unlike the powerful Winged Victory, this sculpture radiates a softer, more natural beauty. The missing arms contribute to what’s known as “the beauty of imperfection,” which is one of the reasons for her fame. Her slightly raised left foot supports her slipping garment, while the artist’s skillful rendering of her body lines creates a sense of elegance and grace.

### **Cuisine**

![framboise](/images/posts/paris-20240125/framboise.jpg)

La Jacobine was the best restaurant we dined at in France, but it was also the most expensive. We ordered a full three-course meal with an appetizer, main course, and dessert. I’m not great at describing food, so I’ll just share the two dishes that I found most memorable—the duck confit and raspberry cake. Duck confit is a signature French dish and a must-try, but this restaurant’s version was even more flavorful than the one we had earlier in the trip. The skin was crispy, and the meat was incredibly tender. As for the raspberry cake, I wasn’t initially interested, but after tasting it, I gained a new appreciation for the combination of berries and cakes. The raspberries were perfectly balanced—sweet with just the right amount of tartness to cut through the richness of the cake. It was definitely a highlight worth mentioning.

### **Daily Summary**

Even though we only spent two days in Paris, it’s definitely a city I’d love to revisit. Paris is highly modernized, with convenient transportation and a stylish atmosphere—it felt like an upgraded version of Taipei. The biggest difference I noticed between Europe and Asia is their strong emphasis on ceremony. You can feel it in the ambiance of the restaurants and in the streets. One unique detail is how they cover scaffolding with a cloth
