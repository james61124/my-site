## **Ghent**

I spent just one day in Ghent, primarily for their music festival. The Ghent Festival runs for only 10 days each year. Although there isn’t much information online, the official website lists various activities and parades. We skipped those and instead explored the city's main sights while soaking in the festival vibe. 

We took a Flixbus to Brussels and then a train to Ghent.

### **Sint-Bassfskathedraal**

You can only climb this cathedral during the Ghent Festival, and it costs just €2. It’s the tallest point in Ghent. Compared to Florence, the city feels slightly more modern, but not as much as Vienna’s city center. Looking down from the cathedral, the orange rooftops and streets below felt like something out of a Studio Ghibli movie—a unique experience. Because we climbed the cathedral, we skipped going up the Belfry. But if you visit when the cathedral isn’t open, I’m sure the Belfry offers equally stunning views!

### **Sint-Michielsbrug**

![Sint-Michielsbrug](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/Sint-Michielsbrug.jpg)

This is considered the most beautiful bridge in Ghent, spanning between the Graslei and Korenlei riversides. However, due to the festival crowds, it was a bit too lively to appreciate the romantic riverside view. I’ve heard Ghent's night view is gorgeous, but since it was summer, the daylight was long. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see the city at night, so I may have to return someday.

### **Gravensteen**

![Gravensteen](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/Gravensteen-2.jpg)

The interior of the castle requires an entrance fee, but it's not very expensive, costing less than 10 EUR. I've attached the ticket link below. I've always been curious about big castles, as the storybooks I read as a child mentioned that fire-breathing dragons might be locked inside. Now that I can actually visit a large castle, it feels really cool!

At the entrance, there’s an English audio guide, though I found the language a bit complex, so I gave up on it eventually. Still, I heard it’s quite a fun guide. Inside, the castle presents many medieval elements like knights, counts, punishment methods, and daily life. The part that stood out most was the section on punishment, displaying various torture devices. It felt somewhat overwhelming but piqued my curiosity. I wanted to listen to the guide, but it simply told us to “use your imagination” for this area and didn’t explain further.

From the castle’s rooftop, you get a view of Ghent’s famous three towers—St. Bavo’s Cathedral, the Belfry, and St. Nicholas Church—the city’s tallest structures.

### **Stree Performance**

![street-performance](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/street-performance.jpg)

During my travels, I’ve noticed that Europe has an incredible variety of musical street performers. This time, I encountered an amazing guitar player who played fingerstyle with an insane level of skill. He used a loop pedal to layer sounds and even used something long to bow the guitar strings, making it sound like a cello—a performance I had never seen before.

### **Polé Polé**

This was our last stop. Polé Polé is a unique party that only happens during the Ghent Festival. You can find it in various spots around the city, resembling an outdoor nightclub. DJs play music, and people start dancing. We didn’t stay all night, but apparently, the party continues until morning. It’s a fun and memorable experience.

### **Cuisine**

#### **Delirium Tremens**

![Delirium Tremens](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/Delirium-Tremens.jpg)

I have to mention Delirium Tremens, a famous Belgian beer. You can probably find it everywhere. I’m not much of a beer connoisseur, but this beer is incredibly smooth. It lacks the strong aftertaste of some beers and isn’t bitter at all. It’s probably the best beer I’ve ever had, so if you’re in Belgium, definitely give it a try!

#### **Budget Travel Tip**

![food](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/food.jpg)

Here’s a budget tip I discovered: go to a European supermarket and buy some bread, ham, and cheese. Their ham is ready to eat and comes in large portions, which can last you several meals!

### **Summary**

Ghent’s cityscape reminds me a bit of Bruges—comfortable and relaxed. However, due to the festival, there were far more people than I expected, giving the city a lively vibe. Everywhere we went, there were street performers, adding to the festive atmosphere. Overall, it’s a great city to visit.

## **Brussels**

We only briefly stopped in Brussels while transferring trains, so we didn’t explore many places. We did, however, check out the famous Manneken Pis and Jeanneke Pis statues from our childhood social studies textbooks.

### **Manneken Pis & Jeanneke Pis**

![Manneken-Pis](/images/travel/ghent-20240727/Manneken-Pis.jpg)

I always imagined Manneken Pis to be much larger and located in the center of a fountain. In reality, both statues are small and tucked away in corners, almost like random street decorations. They’re cute, but I’m not sure how they became so famous!

### **Maximiliaanpark**

There’s a small park near the Flixbus station that we stumbled upon while looking for a restroom. It seems like a local park, not a major tourist spot, but it’s filled with activities like basketball, soccer, volleyball, zip lines, and climbing ropes. Since it was a weekend afternoon, the park was packed. We played on the climbing ropes and even joined a basketball game with some locals.

### **Summary**

Brussels, likely due to being the capital, felt a bit messier. There were more strange people on the streets, and it was dirtier overall. My colleagues said that Ghent and Bruges are the must-visit cities in Belgium, so we didn’t spend too much time in Brussels. For me, seeing Manneken Pis was enough.
