This trip was all about heading to the beach, so we didn’t visit many places. I originally planned to go next week, but suddenly noticed that the weather was fantastic this weekend, with temperatures around 30°C. The weather in the Netherlands changes quickly, and good weather doesn’t last long, so I decided to seize the day and head out.

I won't go into details about transportation, as I'm staying in the Netherlands for six months and have already bought an OV card with a weekend free plan. I just rushed to the station and took the train—if you need a travel guide, check out other sources! It's definitely not because I'm too lazy to write one.

### **Scheveningen Beach**

The most famous beach here is Scheveningen Beach. It was really hot that day, and the beach was packed. The tram was so crowded that we had to get off a few stops early and walk the rest of the way.

The beach has golden sand, which is very comfortable and clean. You could easily spend an entire afternoon there without getting bored. However, if I were to go again, I would prepare a bit more:

1. Bring a large towel or mat so you can lie on the sand and sunbathe. Otherwise, you'll find yourself trying to buy one while watching others sunbathing.
2. There are lockers nearby where you can store your valuables, so you don't have to worry about where to leave your belongings when you go into the water. It's still safer to be cautious, even in Europe.
3. A waterproof phone pouch could be handy so you don't have to figure out where to put your phone while swimming. You can keep it with you in the water.
4. Don’t forget to use sunscreen. Although it’s not as hot and humid as Taiwan, the sun here is still very strong.

As a side note, about a kilometer north, there’s supposedly a nude beach, which I believe is Naakstrand Scheveningen. I saw a “no photography” sign on the map. I didn’t check it out myself, but maybe next time I’ll go see if it’s true. According to a colleague, nude beaches here allow nudity but don’t enforce it.

### **Cuisine**

#### **Ming Tin B.V.**

After almost two months in Europe, I finally had my first Chinese meal—so emotional! The Cantonese dim sum was pricey but incredibly delicious. I don’t know if it’s because I haven’t had Asian food in a while, but everything, from the roast duck to the fried rice and sweet and sour dishes, was amazing. And the tea and rice were free, which almost never happens in Europe. However, the fried rice cost 18 EUR, which is quite expensive—back in Taiwan, it would be less than 100 TWD. But whatever, I was craving fried rice!

### **Summary**

This trip was really just about going to the beach. We left at noon and only had one day, so we didn’t visit other spots in The Hague. But since it’s all within the Netherlands, quick trips like this are super convenient—just like taking a high-speed train. Europeans really love sunbathing because their winter days are so short, and they cherish the sun. You’ll see some people who look like they’re already sunburned, but they’re still happily lying on the beach. This trend isn’t as common in Taiwan.
