## **Day 1**

We took a Flixbus from Eindhoven to Brussels and then a train to Bruges. For trains in Belgium, you need to buy a ticket, but for buses, you can just use a credit card to pay directly.

Here are two detailed travel guides I found super helpful. However, the transportation here is quite simple—Google Maps will usually show you the fastest route. I bought my train ticket directly from a machine, and for the bus, you can just tap your credit card.

We spent most of the day wandering around the city. The most distinctive features here are the chocolate and waffles—you’ll find exquisite chocolate shops and waffle stands everywhere. The chocolates come in various types, like those with hazelnuts, small bite-sized pieces sold by weight, or those with citrus flavors. The waffles are denser than those in Taiwan and can be topped with a variety of options. They smell amazing and taste even better.

### **Heilig-Bloedbasiliek**'

Our first stop was the Basilica of the Holy Blood, which is easy to find, located at the corner of Burg Square. It’s said that the church houses the blood of Jesus, though according to Wikipedia, this hasn’t been verified yet.

We were lucky enough to catch the Holy Blood ceremony. We lined up to enter and saw a transparent box containing a piece of blood-stained cloth. When you walk up to the altar, a staff member recites a prayer. The whole experience was quite solemn, and the atmosphere in the church felt sacred and inviolable.

### **Free Walking Tour**

![free-walking-tour](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/free-walking-tour.jpg)

I highly recommend the free walking tour here. The guide holds a large umbrella in the square, so you can spot different tours by their umbrella colors. The tour lasts about two hours, during which the guide takes you to various interesting spots and shares stories and cultural insights that you wouldn’t find on your own. Though tips are optional, most people give something at the end, and some are quite generous, handing out €20 notes.

This walking tour takes you to some lesser-known spots that aren’t in the usual guides. The guide also introduces some local history and culture that you might miss otherwise. It’s really worth signing up for one of these tours. We were curious about how they make money from a free tour, but it turns out they collaborate with local shops, offering tastings and coupons, which makes it even more worthwhile.

  <p>
    滿推薦這裡的 free walking tour，大概兩個小時的時間會有人導覽介紹然後帶你走過這邊的各種有趣的小景點，嚴格上來說雖然給小費是自由心證所以叫做 free walking tour，但我看最後結束的時候大家還是都會給一下，而且滿多人出手闊綽都會直接掏 20 歐出來。這個 walking tour 會帶到一些看攻略或是自己晃晃看不到的地方，還會介紹一些比較冷門的小小歷史文化，非常推薦可以報名一場試試看。我們本來還在思考這種 tour 要從哪裡賺錢，不過他介紹了很多看起來跟他們有合作的店家，會直接帶我們進去試吃，然後還會給 coupon，真的非常划算。

### **Street Performers**

![street-performer](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/street-performer.png)

We came across a saxophone duet. I never realized that the saxophone could make pop music sound so modern. One person played a solo while the other provided a fashionable bass backing. Their performance was incredibly impressive.

### **Sunset Views**

![scene-1](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/scene-1.jpg)

This is a scenic walking route recommended by a blogger named [Lillian](https://lillian.tw/imlillian/). She’s amazing at writing detailed travel guides, and I always check her site before exploring new places. Since it’s summer, the sun doesn’t set until around 10:30 PM, so after dinner, we took a leisurely walk along this route. The canals and streets of Bruges are beautiful, especially in the evening, making it the perfect time for a stroll.

This river looks beautiful no matter how you capture it.

### **Cuisine**

#### **Lion Beige**

![Lion-Beige](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/Lion-Beige.jpg)

This is an authentic local restaurant. We had a plate of filet mignon and a rabbit leg, accompanied by a small glass of red wine. The rabbit leg was quite special; at first bite, it seemed a bit tough and ordinary, but when paired with the apple sauce they provided, it was an absolutely perfect combination. It was so delicious, even though it looked just like a chicken leg. The filet mignon was also good, but they used a bit too much pepper for my taste, so I kept drinking water to balance it out. I heard their menu changes regularly, so it’s a good idea to ask for recommendations when you visit. The owner was very friendly and chatty.

## **Day 2**

We stayed at a hostel the previous night and met an interesting British guy. We chatted a bit, and he told us he had cycled from Scotland to Belgium and was planning to ride all the way to the Netherlands. Quite an adventure!

### **Belfry of Bruges**

![Belfry](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/Belfry.jpg)

This is a 366-step tower, and you need to book online in advance; otherwise, you might have to wait in line for a long time. After climbing so many bell towers in different cities, each one has its unique charm. The most memorable part of Bruges’ Belfry isn’t the view, but the bell music. I originally thought the bells would just chime on the hour, but it turns out there’s actually someone playing a keyboard inside. Each key corresponds to a bell, and there are about 40 bells of various sizes. They even have a program that plays specific tunes in order. It’s incredibly special.

### **Cuisine**

#### **La Dentelliere**

![mussels](/images/posts/bruges-20240713/mussels.jpg)

Mussels are a famous local delicacy here, so we had to try them at least once. This restaurant, recommended by my landlord, is known for serving some of the best mussels. They might look like a big pot of clams, which makes them quite pricey, but the real star is the sauce. The mussels paired with their special sauce are incredibly flavorful, and when combined with warm cherry tomatoes, it's absolutely delicious. If you’re in the area, trying this dish is a must.

### **Summary**

Bruges, also known as the "Venice of the North," is a beautiful city with picturesque canals and charming streets. The weather during this season is perfect for an evening stroll along the river, making it a relaxing and chill experience. It's definitely a city not to be missed when visiting Belgium.
