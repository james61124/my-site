London is a city I might have known about since I was three years old, but I had never been there. For big cities like this, I only knew a few keywords – like the "foggy city," Big Ben, and London Bridge. This time, I was thrilled to finally have the chance to visit and wander around. However, London has so many places to visit that two days really isn't enough to see much. So, we decided to visit just a few of the most important landmarks and save the rest for another trip.

For someone living in Eindhoven, budget airlines are still the best option – cheap and fast. However, since flight schedules aren't as flexible as FlixBus, we had to sleep at the airport on the last night and catch an early morning flight back to the Netherlands. I'll share the interesting story of sleeping at the airport below.

## **Day 1**

The plan for the first day was simple – wander around the area near Big Ben and the London Eye, and casually city walk to soak in the mysterious vibe of London.

### **Big Ben**

I was incredibly moved when I saw Big Ben. In the past, whenever people mentioned London, Big Ben was the only thing I knew – but I never really knew what it was. I didn’t even realize it was an actual clock until I got there. Although no one really does this, just looking up tells you the time – it’s so cool.

You can actually go inside Big Ben by signing up for the Big Ben Tour. Tickets for adults cost €30, and you have to climb 334 steps. Inside, they introduce the history and culture of Big Ben, and you can see how the clock works. But since the ticket was a bit pricey, I decided not to go in – just walking around outside was great too.

There are plenty of good photo spots near Big Ben. Here are a few great locations – the classic shot of Big Ben with a red telephone booth, which often appears in movies, captures the iconic London street view.

### **London Eye**

![London-Eye](/images/travel/London-20240906/London-Eye-1.jpg)

I had heard that the London Eye was stunning, but during the day, it’s basically just a giant Ferris wheel. I debated whether or not to ride it, but since it was expensive and I had tickets for The Phantom of the Opera in the evening, I decided to skip it. There are plenty of photo spots to capture the entire London Eye. This particular location offers a perfect symmetrical view.

My favorite part was seeing the London Eye at night. When lit up, it felt incredibly romantic. A peaceful stroll along the riverbank, with the cool breeze and the glowing lights, was a delightful experience. There are benches along the embankment where you can sit and admire the Ferris wheel. Party boats filled with young people added to the lively atmosphere. We stayed there for a while to soak in the London night before heading back. Europe is so beautiful everywhere – I love it.

### **Covent Garden**

![Covent-Garden](/images/travel/London-20240906/Covent-Garden.jpg)

Covent Garden is a market near the London Eye, and many people visit it alongside Big Ben and the Eye. Unfortunately, we didn’t have much time, but the market was lively and fun. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a street performer in the central area. He was great at engaging the crowd, creating a fantastic atmosphere. The market itself was filled with musicians, street performers, food stalls, and restaurants. I found the architecture charming and the crowd lively but not overwhelming.

One of the best things about being in England is understanding the street performers' banter with the audience. In other parts of Europe, even if I stop to watch, I usually have no idea what they’re saying. Here, I saw a street performer invite an enthusiastic child to play a game, and it reminded me of scenes I hadn’t witnessed back in Taiwan for a long time.

### **The Phantom Of The Opera**

![The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera-2](/images/travel/London-20240906/The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera-2.jpg)

After leaving Covent Garden in the evening, we rushed to the theater to see The Phantom of the Opera. I highly, highly recommend it – honestly, I was overwhelmed after watching it. I believe it’s a musical everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.

A bit of preparation advice: ticket prices vary greatly, sometimes by dozens of euros for just a few rows' difference. The view really does change depending on the seat. Since I bought tickets in advance, they were quite expensive, but you can grab cheaper day tickets if you line up on the day of the performance. The theater itself isn’t very large, but sitting closer lets you clearly see the iconic chandelier fall scene. Otherwise, parts of it might be blocked by the ceiling.

Make sure to review the plot in detail before watching. Although the performance is in English, some of the vocabulary is difficult (or maybe my English just isn’t great). Since it’s sung, I felt like they could have been singing in Italian, and I wouldn’t have known the difference. I could catch a few key words, but I had forgotten most of the plot by the time Act 1 started, so I was a bit lost.

![The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera](/images/travel/London-20240906/The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera.jpg)

There’s so much I want to say, but it’s hard to express in words. A great musical surprises you with its script, stage design, and music.

Speaking of music – I took an orchestration class before, so I have some basic knowledge of orchestral arrangements (though I can’t compose at all). I was amazed by the musical techniques and found many parts inspiring. Sometimes, multiple characters sing at once. There are counterpoints, harmonies, and choral arrangements happening simultaneously. The layers of vocals alone are complex enough, but the instrumental arrangements behind them are even more fascinating. The sound quality was so good that I could hear every melodic line distinctly, as well as the interplay between instruments. The harmonies were especially striking – many parts were dissonant, reflecting the suspense and anger in the plot. It reminded me of random, chaotic sounds I’d make by slamming piano keys, yet it perfectly conveyed the eerie atmosphere. The composers are truly incredible.

The most iconic piece is undoubtedly the musical’s theme song. The moment you hear it, you know it’s The Phantom of the Opera. The repeated chromatic scales, the key changes, and the male lead’s intense singing evoke a mix of tension, anger, and sorrow. This melody recurs throughout the show, but each time, it’s arranged and sung differently to match the mood, which I found brilliant.

Regarding stage design – even though I couldn’t fully understand the dialogue, many of the visual elements on stage were eye-catching. Some scenes could have been mundane, but the production elevated them to iconic moments. For example, in Act 2, when the male lead is assassinated and replaced by the Phantom, the chaos is portrayed by rushing a stretcher with a covered body across the stage. If I were designing it, I might have added an entire scene to show the assassination directly.

Another scene that stood out to me was the contrast between the happy couple and the Phantom’s pain. In one part, the Phantom stands at the front of the stage, singing in anguish, while the couple’s joyful voices echo from behind. In another scene, the Phantom remains on stage, while the background splits open to reveal the couple rowing a boat – a task that should have been the Phantom’s. This visual parallel and emotional contrast were stunning.

My favorite part was near the end when the female lead kisses the Phantom – not out of love, but to save the male lead. The Phantom, heartbroken by the realization that she doesn’t truly love him, lets them go. His anguished cry of "Go away!" as he releases them, leaving himself alone, was utterly gut-wrenching. The epic music at that moment shattered me emotionally.

## **Day 2**

The main itinerary for the second day was to see Taylor’s last day of the exhibition in London, followed by a visit to the legendary London Bridge.

### **V&A Museum**

![V&A](/images/travel/London-20240906/V&A.jpg)

Taylor’s exhibition was held here this time, and it was free. But I noticed that no one seemed to care about the other exhibitions here haha. Everyone queued to get in just to see Taylor’s exhibition, which was scattered among the regular exhibits. People in line were essentially waiting for Taylor’s part, and the other displays were completely ignored — quite amusing.

The exhibition was well thought out. Since Taylor’s lucky number is 13, she set up 13 stations, each representing an album. These were intertwined with the museum’s regular exhibits, though honestly, I don’t really remember what the original displays were because I couldn’t quite understand them — too much art!

### **Science Museum**

![Science-Museum](/images/travel/London-20240906/Science-Museum.jpg)

This wasn’t originally part of the itinerary. I just happened to spot it next to the V&A and decided to walk in since admission was free. I initially thought it was impressive, but later found out that the coolest parts required payment. There was a basement gaming area with lots of machines, about ten euros or so. There were also special exhibitions and IMAX screenings, but all of them required tickets. The free sections mainly featured various exhibitions — we saw displays about rockets and energy, though they weren’t of great interest to us. So, we left early and headed for Tower Bridge.

### **Tower Bridge**

![Tower-Bridge](/images/travel/London-20240906/Tower-Bridge.jpg)

Tower Bridge is one of those landmarks even kindergarteners recognize, so we had to check it out. However, after some research, I found out that the nursery rhyme “London Bridge is Falling Down” actually refers to London Bridge, which is about 0.8 km upstream — not this one.

Tower Bridge can actually open up. There’s a website that lets you check the opening times for the day. Basically, traffic stops on the bridge, the bridge opens to let ships pass, and then closes again. The schedule varies daily, and it doesn’t necessarily open every day. The official site where you can check the lifting times is linked below.

One thing you absolutely can’t miss is Tower Bridge at night. The night view is stunning — the entire bridge and the surrounding path light up. It’s perfect for a riverside walk or a quiet dinner. The riverside path is wider and livelier than the one near the London Eye. There are also small attractions and restaurants nearby. Whenever I leave places like this, I can’t help but wonder if it’ll be the last time I visit, which makes me cherish the view even more.

### **Overnight Experience at STN Airport**

![STN](/images/travel/London-20240906/STN.jpg)

Since our flight out of London was at 6 AM, it didn’t make sense to stay at a hotel just to leave by 3 or 4 AM. Sleeping at the airport seemed like the better option. I thought it would be strange, but the airport was surprisingly lively — everyone was sleeping there. There were seating areas, food, and some people even brought mats to sleep on. I didn’t bring one, so I chose to rest with my head on the table. Lying directly on the ground seemed too cold.

One thing I really want to share is that even if you sleep at the airport, don’t wait too long to go through security. My Ryanair flight closed the gate 30 minutes before departure. I thought getting to security half an hour before the gate closed would be fine — once I passed, I could head to the gate, right? Wrong. Security was packed, and I almost missed my flight. To make matters worse, my bag was flagged for a second check. By the time I cleared security, I had maybe three minutes left before the gate closed. Luckily, there was no passport check.

However, this airport is huge — Gate 90-something felt like it was miles away. I sprinted through the airport, panic rising as I couldn’t even see the boarding gate. Fortunately, I just barely made it. If I had missed the flight, it would have been a costly mistake, possibly forcing me to stay another day.

Later, I found out you can actually go through security the night before, as long as you do it before security closes. Then, you can sleep at any gate you like. This way, you won’t have to worry about rushing through security in the morning.

## **Summary**

The UK has some peculiar aspects. The weather isn’t great — every day we were there was foggy, and when it drizzled, no one used an umbrella. It seems people are just used to it. Unless it’s pouring, it’s not considered rain to them. Also, the internet situation here is bizarre. Sometimes, stepping into a restaurant means losing all signal, not even a single bar. But once you finish eating, the signal returns, or sometimes it cuts out randomly while walking. It’s very different from Taiwan, where you can get signal almost everywhere.

British food isn’t something I particularly miss, which is why I didn’t write much about it. We just grabbed whatever was convenient. Prices weren’t cheap, and the food wasn’t extraordinary. But we were mainly here to soak in the atmosphere, so it didn’t really matter.

The funniest part was the bus schedule — it felt completely fake. A bus ride to Big Ben that was supposed to take 30 minutes ended up crawling through traffic the entire way. I honestly have no idea how they estimate those schedules! Another thing is that the cost of living feels high, possibly because the pound is stronger than the euro. Prices in absolute terms seem similar to other parts of Europe, but when you convert it to pounds, it’s effectively more expensive. For example, a meal priced at 12 euros versus 12 pounds is a noticeable difference.

That said, I don’t dislike the UK. In fact, I found it fascinating. The streets of London are charming, and I don’t know if it’s because of Harry Potter, but the city feels like stepping into a magical world. The Gothic architecture and spires, some of which are over a hundred years old, add to the allure. Part of why I like it might be because many of the books and movies I loved as a kid — like Conan, Arsène Lupin, and Sherlock Holmes — are set here. There’s just this inexplicable draw to London.

I feel like London has so many more places to explore, and it’s definitely a city I’d like to revisit in the future.
