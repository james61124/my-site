          <p>Switzerland is undoubtedly one of the most expensive places in the world. I originally thought the Netherlands and the UK were already pricey, but the cost of living here feels almost 1.5 to 2 times higher than those areas. Despite this, Switzerland remains my favorite country so far. When I used to hear about Switzerland, a few keywords always came up – wealthy people, watches, the Alps, and stunning nature. This time, I finally got to experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>The currency here is the Swiss Franc (Franc), which is roughly equivalent to the Euro but slightly more expensive, though not as costly as the British Pound. For transportation, we took a 10-hour Flixbus ride from Eindhoven to Basel, then hopped on a Swiss train to Bern. From there, we could start exploring. Over the past few days, Bern has been our main transit hub. We stayed in a small town near Bern, so every trip involved passing through Bern – heading out to explore and returning via Bern to our accommodation. If you’re under 25, you can get a Friends Day Ticket for 28 Francs, which lets you take most public transportation. It’s a great deal.</p>
<p>The scenery here gets better each day – from small towns, lakes, and valleys to snow-capped mountains. As a sneak peek, my personal favorites were the lakes on day two and the snowy landscapes on day four.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/start.jpg" alt="start"></p>
<h2 id="day-1---bern"><strong>Day 1 - Bern</strong></h2>
<p>I used to think Zurich was the capital of Switzerland, probably because it’s the only Swiss city I had heard of. However, Bern is actually the capital – a lively little town. The old town area is quite small, just one main street, which makes all the attractions close by and perfect for a half-day or one-day trip. It’s a good warm-up for the journey.</p>
<h3 id="clock-tower"><strong>Clock Tower</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Clock-Tower.JPG" alt="Clock-Tower"></p>
<p>Seeing this clock tower marks the entrance to Bern’s old town. At first glance, it didn’t seem like much, so I later looked up some history about it. The clock tower is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Beyond telling time and displaying astronomical information, it has served as a city gate, prison, and watchtower. It still chimes near the top of each hour. In hindsight, I regret not paying more attention to it when I was there.</p>

<p>The TRUFFE CLASSIQUE, a classic truffle chocolate, is this shop’s signature item. Apparently, no other branch in the world offers this treat – you can only get it in Switzerland. I bought two to try. They’re sold by weight, and our two pieces cost 3.6 Francs, which was pricey. I’m not great at describing food, but I could tell they were delicious. The outer shell is hard chocolate, while the inside is soft and rich. The flavor is intense but not too bitter – something I would definitely buy again if I return.</p>

<h3 id="berner-münster"><strong>Berner Münster</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/church.jpg" alt="church"></p>
<p>I’ve seen so many churches across Europe that I can hardly distinguish them anymore. However, I was surprised to learn this one is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can climb to the top by ascending 344 steps. Besides its Gothic design, it also boasts the tallest bell tower in Switzerland.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/church-2.jpg" alt="church"></p>
<p>The interior looks similar to countless other churches I’ve visited, so if anyone knowledgeable about Christianity can explain the differences to me, I’d appreciate it.</p>

<h3 id="other-attractions"><strong>Other Attractions</strong></h3>
<p>There are several other places to visit in Bern’s old town, but many require admission fees – like the Natural History Museum and Einstein’s former residence. Due to limited time and budget, I skipped these. I don’t feel the need to check off every site in old towns like this. Sometimes, just strolling around, browsing local shops, and taking in the streetscape is enough.</p>
<h3 id="coop"><strong>coop</strong></h3>
<p>Switzerland’s cost of living is no joke. We avoided restaurants entirely, relying on Coop – a chain supermarket – for all our meals. I think we’ve seen and tried just about everything edible we could microwave at our accommodation. Being a broke student means getting creative.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/coop.jpg" alt="church"></p>
<p>One personal recommendation – I found this type of bread at Coop that I haven’t seen elsewhere. It’s filled with rich, crispy chocolate. I probably ate two or three of these each day.</p>
<h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, Bern is a nice place for a half-day trip to ease into traveling, but it doesn’t quite showcase the iconic Swiss landscapes most people envision. Bern is essentially an old town, so if you’re short on time, I’d recommend prioritizing the natural scenery coming up in the following days.</p>
<h2 id="day-2---interlaken"><strong>Day 2 - Interlaken</strong></h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s main goal was to see the lakes and take a boat ride in Interlaken, so the itinerary was a bit scattered. Interlaken gets its name because it’s located between two lakes. The weather was amazing today – even the lakes I saw from the train were stunning. It might sound cliché to describe the water as shimmering, but that’s honestly the best way to put it.</p>
<h3 id="interlaken-west---intetlaken-ost"><strong>Interlaken West - Intetlaken Ost</strong></h3>
<p>This route forms the main sightseeing path through Interlaken’s town area. While it doesn’t run directly along the lakes, it offers a great look at Swiss urban life. Swiss houses have a simple, cozy aesthetic – nothing overly flashy – and the combination of mountains and lakes makes the lifestyle feel calm and peaceful.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Interlaken.jpg" alt="Interlaken"></p>
<p>Paragliders from the mountains land here, but a session costs around 6,000 NTD (approx. 170 USD), so I decided to pass.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Interlaken-2.jpg" alt="Interlaken"></p>
<p>Even though the lake isn’t visible from this path, the route crosses a river that presumably flows directly into the lake. The water’s color was magical – a crystal-clear green that looked pristine.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Interlaken-3.jpg" alt="Interlaken"></p>
<p>Caught in a candid shot, but it turned out great.</p>

<h3 id="speiz"><strong>Speiz</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Speiz-4.jpg" alt="Speiz"></p>
<p>The original plan was to take a boat from Interlaken Ost to Spiez, but we arrived during their midday break. Instead, we took a bus to Spiez, explored the area, and then caught a boat ride back to Interlaken.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Speiz.jpg" alt="Speiz"></p>
<p>The scenery along the way felt like movie frames – I regret not having better photography skills.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Speiz-2.jpg" alt="Speiz"></p>
<p>The area was lively. Walking towards the lake led to a sports zone with people playing various sports. Many families brought their kids here to play.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Speiz-3.jpg" alt="Speiz"></p>
<p>A short walk brought us to the calm port area. From here, I could already see snow-capped mountains in the distance, though I didn’t realize at the time that I’d be climbing up there later. Some parts of the lakeshore didn’t have railings, allowing you to touch the icy water directly. Ducks were everywhere – not sure why, but any body of water here seems to attract them.</p>
<h3 id="boat-ride-speiz---interlaken"><strong>Boat Ride Speiz - Interlaken</strong></h3>
<p>If the weather allows, I highly recommend this boat ride! I honestly believe no viewpoint compares to the sights you see from the water. The best part is that the Friends Day Ticket covers the boat ride, making it even more worth it.</p>

<div style="height: 15px;"></div>
<p>The entire lake glowed in a clear blue hue. From the boat, it felt like the world surrounded us – mountains in every direction. It was breathtaking. At this time of year, snow had already started appearing on the peaks, creating a surreal landscape of lakes, valleys, and scattered snow-capped mountains. As sunlight reflected off the water, I finally understood what people mean by &ldquo;shimmering.&rdquo; It was truly a dreamlike view.</p>

<h3 id="golden-bridge"><strong>Golden Bridge</strong></h3>
<p>After the boat ride, we walked to this bridge – a spot often recommended in travel guides. The weather remained perfect, and the clear green river looked incredibly refreshing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Golden-Bridge.jpg" alt="Golden Bridge"></p>
<p>This is the riverside view. At the time, I only thought the green looked nice, but my travel buddies insisted it was “Tiffany green”. I am curious why different bodies of water display different colors. For example, Königsee in Germany is a vibrant green, while lakes here are blue, and small rivers take on yet another shade of green. It’s fascinating.</p>

<h2 id="summary-1"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Switzerland&rsquo;s picturesque lakes and mountains completely overturned my imagination of beautiful nature. The slopes are covered in pristine green, and the houses on the hillsides are all wooden, with subtle color palettes. It feels like stepping into an animated scene of the Alps, full of leisure and charm. The lakes are vast and incredibly clean, and under the sunlight, the entire landscape feels like a paradise on earth. I have no regrets about the long journey to this country.</p>
<h2 id="day-3"><strong>Day 3</strong></h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s weather was not as good as yesterday, with a noticeable drop in temperature. The snow line on the mountains also descended. European weather can change in an instant. After experiencing the grand lake views yesterday, I decided to head up the mountains today and visit the small towns there.</p>
<h3 id="lauterbrunnen"><strong>Lauterbrunnen</strong></h3>
<p>This town is known as the waterfall village. If you don&rsquo;t walk too far in, the main road is actually quite short. Unfortunately, during this season, the waterfalls have less water. The houses in Swiss towns are simple and charming, with clean colors that aren&rsquo;t too flashy, giving off a fairytale vibe.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Lauterbrunnen.jpg" alt="Lauterbrunnen"></p>
<p>Right after getting off the train, you can already see the street view here. Just by looking at the people and the sky, you can feel how cold it was that day. In the distance, you can see the snow-capped mountains, feeling closer to them than ever before.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Lauterbrunnen-2.jpg" alt="Lauterbrunnen"></p>
<p>As you walk, you&rsquo;ll reach the most famous photo spot, where you can see the entire valley, the snowy mountains in the background, and the waterfall to the side. However, due to the season, the waterfall&rsquo;s flow was quite small, which was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Lauterbrunnen-3.jpg" alt="Lauterbrunnen"></p>
<p>This was about the furthest point we walked to. What stood out to me was the uniquely green color of the river, even without strong sunlight.</p>

<h3 id="wengen"><strong>Wengen</strong></h3>
<p>Wengen&rsquo;s natural scenery might not be the most impressive, but I must introduce these fun attractions.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Wengen.jpg" alt="Wengen"></p>
<p>This giant chess set is actually playable! If it weren&rsquo;t for the time constraints, I would have found a passerby to play with. Interestingly, many shops here sell chess sets.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Wengen-2.jpg" alt="Wengen"></p>
<p>There are plenty of curious things here, like this marble track. Apparently, you can buy marbles at the service center to play, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure.</p>
<h3 id="grindelwald"><strong>Grindelwald</strong></h3>
<p>Our original plan was to visit Mürren, but fearing potential snowfall and inadequate gear, we changed our destination to Grindelwald. We didn&rsquo;t stay long, heading directly to the Dream Hill as everyone was getting tired. However, here we truly experienced the grandeur of the valley. Lauterbrunnen&rsquo;s valley was beautiful, but compared to Grindelwald, it felt like a mere prelude.</p>

<div style="height: 15px;"></div>
<p>This is Dream Hill. The green slopes are uniformly vibrant, and the houses blend harmoniously into the scenery, creating a dreamlike atmosphere straight out of a movie.</p>

<h3 id="summary-2"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Compared to the lakes from the second day, today&rsquo;s towns seemed less remarkable. However, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s because they aren&rsquo;t special. I still loved the street scenes and atmosphere, but perhaps after spending so much time in Europe, I felt a little aesthetically fatigued by fairytale towns. Additionally, the weather wasn&rsquo;t ideal, and the lighting wasn&rsquo;t perfect. Nevertheless, I don&rsquo;t regret this part of the trip at all.</p>
<h2 id="day-4---jungfraujoch"><strong>Day 4 - Jungfraujoch</strong></h2>
<p>The last day in Switzerland was absolutely incredible. I never expected to find myself at Jungfraujoch. Our original plan was to hike at Männlichen, but after checking the webcams in the morning, we saw clear skies at Jungfraujoch while Männlichen was shrouded in fog. We made a quick decision to head to Jungfraujoch instead.</p>
<p>Getting there was straightforward. I took public transport to Grindelwald Terminal, where I purchased a return ticket to Jungfraujoch. The ticket machine was easy to navigate. The journey involved taking a cable car from Grindelwald Terminal to Eigergletscher, followed by a train to Jungfraujoch.</p>
<p>That said, Jungfraujoch is extremely expensive. A round trip ticket cost 200 Francs, which was painful. Friends&rsquo; day tickets no longer covered the route past Grindelwald Terminal. Most people use half-fare cards (50% off) or Swiss Passes (25% off) to reduce the cost. Despite the price, it was totally worth it. Jungfraujoch only has about 80 clear days a year, and who knows how many times I&rsquo;ll visit Switzerland in my lifetime. With the perfect weather and a sea of clouds beneath the peak, I knew I would regret not going.</p>
<h3 id="grindwald-terminal"><strong>Grindwald Terminal</strong></h3>

</div>

<div style="height: 15px;"></div>
<p>This is the mountain view next to Grindwald Terminal. The clouds on the mountains today are generally low, and we seriously suspect that the location of those clouds is exactly where we originally planned to go – Männlichen. So, we have to go above these clouds to see the blue sky. The valleys of the Alps are vast and spectacular, and the color of the grass is so pure. Combined with the random clusters of small wooden houses in between, the scenery is absolutely stunning.</p>
<h3 id="grindwald-terminal---eigergletscher"><strong>Grindwald Terminal - Eigergletscher</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-4.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>We were barely halfway up the cable car when we already felt the trip was worth it. The vastness of the world is beyond imagination. In the cable car, you feel surrounded by mountains, standing at a high vantage point overlooking the entire valley – it’s breathtaking. The cable cars here are very different from the ones in Taiwan. Not only are the cabins large enough to hold over 20 people, but the floor-to-ceiling windows allow for an even broader view.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-5.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>This is the view just before reaching the clouds. Looking down, you see the entire green valley; looking up, you enter the snow line and head straight into the clouds. After that, taking the train through the clouds will lead you to Jungfraujoch.</p>
<h3 id="eigergletscher---jungfraujoch"><strong>Eigergletscher - Jungfraujoch</strong></h3>
<p>This part involves a train ride, and there’s no view outside. However, you can clearly feel the rapid climb in altitude. The cable car and train together ascend over 2,000 meters within an hour. There is a brief stop along the way at a viewpoint for passengers to take photos. It’s basically a small cave, but we didn’t get off, thinking we could see the outside later anyway.</p>
<h3 id="jungfraujoch---top-of-europe"><strong>Jungfraujoch - Top of Europe</strong></h3>
<p>Now for the main highlight – at the top, it was about -2 degrees. After getting off the train, the routes are well planned, making it easy to explore. A full loop brings you back to the station. Although the locals recommend staying for at least two hours, we only stayed for one because we arrived late and didn’t want to miss the last train. It felt a bit rushed, but we still saw everything we wanted to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>At the first outdoor spot, you can see ski tracks, suggesting this area is likely a ski resort. I hadn’t seen snow in a long time and was thrilled by the sight. In the distance, I saw what looked like a glacial canyon. The clear blue sky and the snow-capped mountains were incredibly moving. I initially thought wearing sneakers to climb a snowy mountain would be inconvenient, but it wasn’t too bad. I expected my shoes to get wet, but the walkable areas had been hardened by other visitors, so my shoes didn’t get wet. However, the ground was slippery, and with the strong winds on the mountain, walking was tricky – but still totally worth it.</p>

</div>

<div style="height: 15px;"></div>
<p>Looking at the snow under the bright sun made me realize that sunglasses would have been helpful. I was too excited to think about it at the time, but in hindsight, it was indeed quite bright.</p>
<h4 id="observation-deck"><strong>Observation Deck</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-2.JPG" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>Continuing the walk leads to an observation deck, which was my favorite view. To the right is a vast glacier and snow-capped mountains, with a majestic canyon in full view. To the left is a sea of clouds. I could imagine the cable car and train piercing through this sea of clouds to reach the top – truly spectacular.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-6.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>Looking to the right, this is what you see – a huge canyon, incredibly grand. At that moment, I felt the trip was entirely worth it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-7.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<h4 id="ice-palace"><strong>Ice Palace</strong></h4>
<p>There’s also an ice palace to visit here. For someone from Taiwan, an ice palace is fascinating because there’s nowhere in Taiwan with cold enough temperatures to build one that won’t melt. I used to wonder if ice palaces ever melted, so seeing one for the first time was so exciting. I touched the ice walls – they were sturdier and smoother than I expected. At sub-zero temperatures, melting wasn’t an issue at all – so much fun!</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Ice-Palace-2.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>The long, endless corridor felt eerie at times since no one else was around. I couldn’t help but wonder if I might get locked in – funny how your imagination runs wild while traveling.</p>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Ice-Palace.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>There were many ice sculptures like this. I’m sharing my favorite one!</p>
<h4 id="swiss-flag"><strong>Swiss Flag</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-3.jpg" alt="Jungfraujoch"></p>
<p>Finally, this is the famous spot where people line up to take photos with the Swiss flag – a must-see attraction. Some don’t like this spot because, during peak season, the line can be long just to take a photo with someone else’s flag. I guess I was lucky – since it was the off-season and near closing time, there weren’t many people, and I got my photo quickly. The biggest challenge wasn’t the crowd but the wind. Since the slope is slightly inclined and my shoes had no grip, I struggled to stay steady on the windy summit. On the way down, I slid down the slope, but it was pretty fun.</p>
<h3 id="summary-3"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The most impressive part of the trip was definitely Jungfraujoch. However, if you ask whether it offers the best value for money, I’m not so sure – it’s incredibly expensive and does feel a bit overly commercialized. But you never know how many chances you’ll have to visit Switzerland in your lifetime. Sometimes, getting “ripped off” to see world-class scenery feels worth it. What moved me the most was that, for the first three days, I kept seeing ads for the &ldquo;Top of Europe&rdquo; everywhere, and on the last day, I was actually standing there. It still felt unreal.</p>
<p>Switzerland was much more beautiful than I had imagined. Maybe the great weather acted as a filter, but seeing the Alps and lakes described in textbooks, feeling the wealthy atmosphere, and noticing that even the elderly and children on the trains were reading books instead of looking at their phones – it was all very refreshing. The world is vast, and being able to take this trip during my brief stay in Europe made it all feel worthwhile.</p>
