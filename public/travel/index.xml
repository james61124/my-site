      <description>This trip was all about heading to the beach, so we didn’t visit many places. I originally planned to go next week, but suddenly noticed that the weather was fantastic this weekend, with temperatures around 30°C.

      <description>Day 1 My first solo trip was to Europe, and the moment I got off the plane, everything felt new.
