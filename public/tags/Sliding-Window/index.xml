    <description><![CDATA[Given an integer array nums, along with two integers k and threshold, find the number of subarrays of length k whose average is greater than or equal to threshold.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/
Problem Analysis The goal is to find all subarrays of length k that meet the given condition. This means we need to examine every subarray of length k.
Brute Force A straightforward approach is to enumerate all possible subarrays of length k.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
Problem Analysis The objective is to find the longest substring without repeating characters, meaning we must examine every possible substring.
Brute Force The most straightforward brute-force approach is to enumerate all possible substrings and check for repeated characters. However, this results in a time complexity of O(nÂ²), which is too slow and will cause time limit exceeded (TLE) errors.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given a positive integer array nums and a target value target, find the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/
Method 1 - Sliding Window This problem can be solved using the Sliding Window technique. Since all numbers in the array are positive, we know that if a subarray sum reaches or exceeds target, adding more numbers will only make it longer but won&rsquo;t help find the shortest subarray.]]></description>
