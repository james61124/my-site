    <description><![CDATA[Given an integer array nums, along with two integers k and threshold, find the number of subarrays of length k whose average is greater than or equal to threshold.
LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/
Problem Analysis The goal is to find all subarrays of length k that meet the given condition. This means we need to examine every subarray of length k.
Brute Force A straightforward approach is to enumerate all possible subarrays of length k.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
Problem Analysis The objective is to find the longest substring without repeating characters, meaning we must examine every possible substring.
Brute Force The most straightforward brute-force approach is to enumerate all possible substrings and check for repeated characters. However, this results in a time complexity of O(n¬≤), which is too slow and will cause time limit exceeded (TLE) errors.]]></description>
