    <description><![CDATA[Given an array, find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The elements in this subsequence must appear in increasing order but do not need to be consecutive in the original array.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/
Method 1 - Dynamic Programming Time Complexity - O( n^2 ), due to the nested loops.
Space Complexity - O( n ), as we need an array of size n for dp.
Step 1 Create a dp array where dp[i] represents the length of the LIS that ends at nums[i].]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of pi , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?
Method 1: Recursion The most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion. As shown in the figure below, rn represents the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod of length n. Suppose i is the length of the first segment in the optimal solution; then rn = pi + rnâˆ’i, because pi is the revenue from the first segment in the optimal solution, and adding the maximum revenue from the remaining part gives us the answer.]]></description>
