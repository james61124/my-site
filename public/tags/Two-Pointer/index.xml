    <description><![CDATA[In a given array, each element represents the height of a vertical line. The task is to choose two lines such that the container formed with the x-axis can hold the maximum amount of water and return that maximum volume.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
Solution - Opposite Direction Two Pointers The key idea is that the area of the container is determined by:
Area = min(Height of left, Height of right) Ã— Distance between them We aim to find two lines that maximize this area.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This problem is a variation of Two Sum. Given an array sorted in ascending order, the goal is to find two numbers whose sum equals the target value and return their 1-based indices.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/
Method - Opposite Direction Two Pointers This problem can be solved using opposite direction two-pointer technique, since this problem is about finding elements under certain constraints in a sorted array. Set left pointer at the first element and right pointer at the last element.]]></description>

    <title>[ Leetcode 26 ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Solution Approach &amp; Explanation</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Given an ascending sorted array - nums, the task is to remove duplicate elements in place so that each element appears only once and return the new length of the array.
âš  Requirementsï¼š
Extra array space cannot be used; modifications must be done in place. If the returned array length is k, it means the first k elements of nums contain the result after removing duplicates, while the remaining elements can be arbitrary and do not need to be considered.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This problem requires determining whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/
Solution - Opposite Direction Two Pointers This problem can be solved using an opposite direction two-pointer approach. The idea is to check whether the characters at the left and right pointers are the same. If they are, both pointers move inward. The main points to consider are ensuring that left and right do not go out of bounds and using isalnum() to check whether a character is alphanumeric.]]></description>
