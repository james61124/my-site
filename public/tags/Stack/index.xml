    <description><![CDATA[Given a string s containing only the characters (, ), {, }, [ and ], check whether the string forms a valid set of parentheses.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
Problem Analysis This is a classic First In, Last Out (FILO) problem, which makes a stack the ideal data structure for solving it. We also need to consider edge cases carefully.
Solution - Stack We use a stack while iterating through the string:
If we encounter a left parenthesis, we push it onto the stack.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given a string containing non-negative integers, +, -, *, /, and spaces, evaluate its value while following the standard order of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction). The use of eval() is not allowed.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/
Problem Analysis Since multiplication and division must be processed before addition and subtraction, the problem requires handling Last In, First Out (LIFO) operations. This suggests that a stack would be an effective data structure to use.]]></description>

    <title>[ Leetcode 496 ] Next Greater Element I | Solution Approach &amp; Explanation</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Given two arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2, we need to find the next greater element for each number in nums1 within nums2.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/
Problem Analysis The key challenge is how to efficiently find the next greater element for each number in nums1 without iterating over nums2 repeatedly. A brute-force approach would be too slow, so we need an optimized method.
Solution - Monotone Stack The design of the Monotone Stack fits perfectly for this problem because we can ensure that the numbers in the stack are always in decreasing order.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given an integer array temperatures, representing the temperature on each day, for each day, we need to find the nearest future day with a higher temperature and return the number of days between the current day and that day. If there is no higher temperature in the future, return 0.
LinkðŸ”—ï¼šhttps://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
Problem Analysis The key to this problem is finding the next number greater than the current one, so we can directly think of using a Monotone Stack.]]></description>
