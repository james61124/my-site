    <description><![CDATA[Ghent I spent just one day in Ghent, primarily for their music festival. The Ghent Festival runs for only 10 days each year. Although there isn’t much information online, the official website lists various activities and parades. We skipped those and instead explored the city&rsquo;s main sights while soaking in the festival vibe.
We took a Flixbus to Brussels and then a train to Ghent.
Sint-Bassfskathedraal You can only climb this cathedral during the Ghent Festival, and it costs just €2.]]></description>
