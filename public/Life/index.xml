      <description>The Mei-Chu Hackathon is the largest student-run hackathon in Taiwan. Let me first briefly introduce what a hackathon is: the term combines &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Marathon.&amp;rdquo; During the competition, participants are required to complete a project within a very short timeframe, from idea generation to actual implementation. This makes it a highly challenging event. As part of the organizing team, our goal is to ensure the smooth running of the event while addressing past issues and introducing new innovations to make the event better every year.</description>

      <description>Due to my role as an organizer for the Meichu Hackathon over the past two years, it was only natural for me to return and participate again. Apart from gaining practical experience, I also wanted to see how the next generation of students prepared for the event.&#xA;Project Introduction Text Mode This feature is designed for individuals with poor vision. Many elderly people often struggle to read small text, such as labels and instructions.</description>
