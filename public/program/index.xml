      <description>Given that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of pi , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?&#xA;Method 1: Recursion The most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion. As shown in the figure below, rn represents the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod of length n. Suppose i is the length of the first segment in the optimal solution; then rn = pi + rn−i, because pi is the revenue from the first segment in the optimal solution, and adding the maximum revenue from the remaining part gives us the answer.</description>
