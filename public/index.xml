      <description>The Sliding Window technique utilizes two pointers, left and right, to maintain a dynamic range (window). By shifting this window, we can reduce redundant computations, making it particularly useful for problems involving subarrays or substrings.&#xA;Sliding Window is categorized into two types:&#xA;Fixed-Size Sliding Window Variable-Size Sliding Window Fixed-Size Sliding Window Used for problems that require subarrays or substrings of a fixed length. The window moves one step to the right at a time, removing the leftmost element and adding a new rightmost element.</description>

      <description>Given a positive integer array nums and a positive integer k, find the number of subarrays whose product is less than k.&#xA;LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/&#xA;Problem Analysis This problem is straightforward if you think from a two-pointer perspective. The key is to carefully determine which node points to which, and which pointer moves forward.&#xA;Solution - Two Pointers We need a pointer cur to track the last merged node. We compare the values of list1 and list2, and link cur-&amp;gt;next to the smaller one.</description>

      <description>Given a linked list, determine whether it contains a cycle.&#xA;LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/&#xA;Solution - Fast and Slow Pointers ( Floyd&amp;rsquo;s Cycle Detection Algorithm ) This is one of the classic problems for detecting a cycle in a linked list. The idea is to use two pointers, where the fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.</description>

      <description>Given two strings, text1 and text2, find the length of their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).&#xA;‚ö†Ô∏è Note:&#xA;A subsequence does not need to be contiguous but must maintain the original order. If there is no common subsequence, return 0. LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/&#xA;Solution - DP (Double-Sequence Linear DP Problem) This problem can be solved using Double-Sequence Linear DP, as the input consists of two strings.

      <description>This problem requires determining whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.&#xA;LinküîóÔºöhttps://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/&#xA;Solution - Opposite Direction Two Pointers This problem can be solved using an opposite direction two-pointer approach. The idea is to check whether the characters at the left and right pointers are the same. If they are, both pointers move inward. The main points to consider are ensuring that left and right do not go out of bounds and using isalnum() to check whether a character is alphanumeric.</description>

      <description>Binary Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a key value in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly narrowing the search range in half, allowing it to quickly locate the target. As a result, the time complexity of Binary Search is O(logn).&#xA;Basic Steps Compare the target with the middle value. If they are equal, return the index. If the target is less than the middle value, narrow the search range to the left half.</description>

      <description>The Mei-Chu Hackathon is the largest student-run hackathon in Taiwan. Let me first briefly introduce what a hackathon is: the term combines &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Marathon.&amp;rdquo; During the competition, participants are required to complete a project within a very short timeframe, from idea generation to actual implementation. This makes it a highly challenging event. As part of the organizing team, our goal is to ensure the smooth running of the event while addressing past issues and introducing new innovations to make the event better every year.</description>

      <description>Given that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of pi , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?&#xA;Method 1: Recursion The most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion. As shown in the figure below, rn represents the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod of length n. Suppose i is the length of the first segment in the optimal solution; then rn = pi + rn‚àíi, because pi is the revenue from the first segment in the optimal solution, and adding the maximum revenue from the remaining part gives us the answer.</description>
