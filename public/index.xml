      <description>This problem is a variation of Two Sum. Given an array sorted in ascending order, the goal is to find two numbers whose sum equals the target value and return their 1-based indices.&#xA;Link🔗：https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/&#xA;Method - Two Pointers（Opposite Direction） This problem can be solved using opposite direction two-pointer technique, since this problem is about finding elements under certain constraints in a sorted array. Set left pointer at the first element and right pointer at the last element.</description>

      <description>Going abroad for an internship was probably the biggest but also the most successful decision I have ever made in my life. Spending six months exploring the world outside was an incredible experience, and even now, looking back, it still feels surreal. Returning to Taiwan afterward felt somewhat unreal. Here, I want to share the bits and pieces of these six months.&#xA;🔥 Why Choose the ASML Netherlands Headquarters Internship Program?</description>

      <title>[ Leetcode 125 ] Valid Palindrome | Solution Approach &amp; Explanation</title>
      <link>https://jamesblogger.com/program/leetcode-125/</link>

      <description>This problem requires determining whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.&#xA;Link🔗：https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/&#xA;Solution - Opposite Direction Two Pointers This problem can be solved using an opposite direction two-pointer approach. The idea is to check whether the characters at the left and right pointers are the same. If they are, both pointers move inward. The main points to consider are ensuring that left and right do not go out of bounds and using isalnum() to check whether a character is alphanumeric.</description>

      <title>[ Leetcode 209 ] Minimum Size Subarray Sum | Solution Approach &amp; Explanation</title>
      <link>https://jamesblogger.com/program/leetcode-209/</link>

      <description>Given a positive integer array nums and a target value target, find the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If no such subarray exists, return 0.&#xA;Link🔗：https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/&#xA;Method 1 - Sliding Window This problem can be solved using the Sliding Window technique. Since all numbers in the array are positive, we know that if a subarray sum reaches or exceeds target, adding more numbers will only make it longer but won&amp;rsquo;t help find the shortest subarray.</description>

      <description>Given an array, find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The elements in this subsequence must appear in increasing order but do not need to be consecutive in the original array.&#xA;Link🔗：https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/&#xA;Method 1 - Dynamic Programming Time Complexity - O( n^2 ), due to the nested loops.&#xA;Space Complexity - O( n ), as we need an array of size n for dp.&#xA;Step 1 Create a dp array where dp[i] represents the length of the LIS that ends at nums[i].</description>

      <description>There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n-1. Each rooms[i] contains a list of keys that can be used to unlock other rooms. Initially, you start in room 0, which is already unlocked. The goal is to determine whether you can visit all rooms.&#xA;Link🔗：https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/&#xA;Solution - DFS This problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS), as it is essentially a graph traversal problem. The rooms and their keys form a directed graph, where a key in rooms[i] represents an edge from room i to another room.</description>

      <guid>https://jamesblogger.com/program/binary-search/</guid>
      <description>Binary Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a key value in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly narrowing the search range in half, allowing it to quickly locate the target. As a result, the time complexity of Binary Search is O(logn).&#xA;Basic Steps Compare the target with the middle value. If they are equal, return the index. If the target is less than the middle value, narrow the search range to the left half.</description>

      <title>Switzerland Free Travel | 4-Day Immersive Journey into the Alpine Wonderland – From Lakes to Snowy Peaks</title>
      <link>https://jamesblogger.com/travel/Switzerland-20240914/</link>

      <description>Switzerland is undoubtedly one of the most expensive places in the world. I originally thought the Netherlands and the UK were already pricey, but the cost of living here feels almost 1.5 to 2 times higher than those areas. Despite this, Switzerland remains my favorite country so far. When I used to hear about Switzerland, a few keywords always came up – wealthy people, watches, the Alps, and stunning nature. This time, I finally got to experience it firsthand.</description>

      <title>England - Two Days in London 20240906</title>

      <description>London is a city I might have known about since I was three years old, but I had never been there. For big cities like this, I only knew a few keywords – like the &amp;ldquo;foggy city,&amp;rdquo; Big Ben, and London Bridge. This time, I was thrilled to finally have the chance to visit and wander around. However, London has so many places to visit that two days really isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to see much.</description>

      <description>Day 1 We took a Flixbus overnight from Eindhoven to Munich, a trip that took more than 10 hours. Besides being cheap, there aren’t many perks to this kind of journey—sleeping upright in a seat and not being able to stretch your legs is tough, and then having to start exploring right after arriving is even tougher. But, at least we saved two nights&amp;rsquo; worth of accommodation costs, which is great because otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;d be broke.</description>

      <description>Ghent I spent just one day in Ghent, primarily for their music festival. The Ghent Festival runs for only 10 days each year. Although there isn’t much information online, the official website lists various activities and parades. We skipped those and instead explored the city&amp;rsquo;s main sights while soaking in the festival vibe.&#xA;We took a Flixbus to Brussels and then a train to Ghent.&#xA;Sint-Bassfskathedraal You can only climb this cathedral during the Ghent Festival, and it costs just €2.</description>

      <description>This trip was all about heading to the beach, so we didn’t visit many places. I originally planned to go next week, but suddenly noticed that the weather was fantastic this weekend, with temperatures around 30°C. The weather in the Netherlands changes quickly, and good weather doesn’t last long, so I decided to seize the day and head out.&#xA;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details about transportation, as I&amp;rsquo;m staying in the Netherlands for six months and have already bought an OV card with a weekend free plan.</description>

      <description>Day 1 We took a Flixbus from Eindhoven to Brussels and then a train to Bruges. For trains in Belgium, you need to buy a ticket, but for buses, you can just use a credit card to pay directly. Here are two detailed travel guides I found super helpful. However, the transportation here is quite simple—Google Maps will</description>

      <description>I was the president of the NCTU Guitar Club. My sophomore year in the club was more than just enjoying university life and making new friends; it was an important life experience and a serious dedication to music.&#xA;Why I Wanted to Become President There were two key reasons: developing leadership skills and my passion for music.&#xA;I’ve always believed that university is a time when you can afford to take risks.</description>

      <description>Day 1 My first solo trip was to Europe, and the moment I got off the plane, everything felt new. Standing in a foreign city, surrounded by an unfamiliar environment and language, the word &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; defined our entire journey. No matter how well-prepared we were, exploring a new country and culture always brings unexpected surprises and insights. The main takeaway from this trip was experiencing these cities firsthand, not just for the attractions, but also for their overall atmosphere and culture.</description>

      <description>The Mei-Chu Hackathon is the largest student-run hackathon in Taiwan. Let me first briefly introduce what a hackathon is: the term combines &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Marathon.&amp;rdquo; During the competition, participants are required to complete a project within a very short timeframe, from idea generation to actual implementation. This makes it a highly challenging event. As part of the organizing team, our goal is to ensure the smooth running of the event while addressing past issues and introducing new innovations to make the event better every year.</description>

      <description>Given that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of pi , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?&#xA;Method 1: Recursion The most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion. As shown in the figure below, rn represents the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod of length n. Suppose i is the length of the first segment in the optimal solution; then rn = pi + rn−i, because pi is the revenue from the first segment in the optimal solution, and adding the maximum revenue from the remaining part gives us the answer.</description>

      <description>What is Github？ Git is a version control software, while Github is an online platform for storing code. It organizes projects into repositories, allowing users to use Git for version control and making collaboration within a team easier.&#xA;Why Use Github In a project, I make changes to A, someone else modifies B, and I update C. Things can quickly get messy.&#xA;It can store a large collection of your work portfolio.</description>
