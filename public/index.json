[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThis trip was all about heading to the beach, so we didn’t visit many places. I originally planned to go next week, but suddenly noticed that the weather was fantastic this weekend, with temperatures around 30°C. The weather in the Netherlands changes quickly, and good weather doesn’t last long, so I decided to seize the day and head out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0026rsquo;t go into details about transportation, as I\u0026rsquo;m staying in the Netherlands for six months and have already bought an OV card with a weekend free plan.

But since it’s all within the Netherlands, quick trips like this are super convenient—just like taking a high-speed train. Europeans really love sunbathing because their winter days are so short, and they cherish the sun.

Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a fundamental solution, so we focused on increasing visibility through better promotion and careful scheduling (like having freshmen perform first to attract their friends and family). Despite these challenges, we were fortunate that the event went well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"member-gathering---bbq-party\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMember Gathering - BBQ Party\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, this event didn’t exist, but after observing the club for a semester, I realized that cohesion within the group isn’t solely dependent on members’ skill levels. We needed to spend more time strengthening bonds within the club. With increased unity, activities naturally become more enjoyable and attract more participation. So, I decided to host this event to enhance the club’s sense of community. Although it wasn’t perfectly organized as a first-time event, it achieved its purpose. I’m happy to see that future cohorts have continued and improved upon this tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"folk-night\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFolk Night\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was supposed to be the main event of the year, but sadly, due to the pandemic, all large-scale events were canceled by the university. It was disappointing since we had already done substantial preparation. We had to return all our sponsorships, discard all promotional materials, and cancel all rehearsals. Although I felt sorry for everyone, it was something beyond our control. Despite not having a proper conclusion to the year, looking back, I’m grateful for the many memorable experiences—meeting amazing people, organizing performances, and working to improve the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reflections-on-my-leadership-experience\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReflections on My Leadership Experience\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading a team is truly an area where you constantly learn. Throughout the year, I found myself swinging between various choices and compromises. The most important lesson I learned is that it’s impossible to make decisions that satisfy everyone. I once heard a quote I really like: “A good decision-maker is someone who can make the best and quickest decisions.” This may sound like a cliché, but it highlights a real dilemma. The reason you can’t make a quick decision is often because it seems like no matter what you choose, someone or something will be affected. You need to understand what’s most important for your team and learn to prioritize by sacrificing less critical aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflecting on my performance throughout the year, I feel that my decisions were too “soft.” Being “soft” means that while maintaining event quality, you inevitably sacrifice your own time and that of the officers. Good event quality requires extensive preparation. NCTU isn’t a university known for strong club culture since it’s more academically focused. Motivating the team to make sacrifices for club activities was a significant challenge. I couldn’t guarantee success in their academic lives, so I hesitated to push them too hard, which led to two outcomes: a slight compromise in event quality and burning myself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the perspective of a leader, it’s crucial to see the bigger picture and effectively use available resources. I think a fitting way to describe it is: “You don’t need to complete every task yourself, but you must ensure that every task is completed.” This is a different mindset from that of a regular officer, who only needs to complete assigned tasks. A leader must ensure that once tasks are delegated, the event can proceed smoothly. Can they complete the tasks? If unexpected issues arise, are there backup plans? To address these questions, you need to invest more effort in thinking through the details. This brings us to another balancing act: deciding which details are worth focusing on and which are not. If you focus on every detail, meetings become extremely long. But if you delegate and let go entirely, something is bound to go wrong. It’s essential to ensure that meetings efficiently cover the key points while each team tracks their progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, my sophomore year brought significant changes to my life. I used to focus only on matters directly related to me, but my experience in the club taught me to see the world from a broader perspective. It also instilled in me the pressure of responsibility. Therefore, I believe that during university, it’s essential to pursue learning not only through academic achievements but also by gaining other important values from different experiences that broaden your horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/GuitarClub.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/guitar-club/","title":"NCTU Guitar Club Experience"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"project-overview\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProject Overview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe designed a system called \u0026ldquo;Dida Dream - Timely Assistance System,\u0026rdquo; aiming to achieve food redistribution by integrating a platform for near-expiry products with an online donation channel.

Standing in a foreign city, surrounded by an unfamiliar environment and language, the word \u0026ldquo;unknown\u0026rdquo; defined our entire journey. No matter how well-prepared we were, exploring a new country and culture always brings unexpected surprises and insights.

Climbing the 200 steps to the top offers a stunning view of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower as a breathtaking backdrop. The Arc is at the hub of 12 radiating roads, and because we visited during rush hour, the roundabout was completely clogged with traffic, disrupting the flow of all the connecting avenues. Standing at the top, we could hear endless honking, and the sheer scale of the traffic jam was oddly impressive, reflecting the frustration of those stuck in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"seine-river\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeine River\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Seine-River\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Seine-River.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople often say the Seine is a romantic river, and a river cruise is a must-do activity. The cruise offers views of many famous Paris landmarks while you enjoy the cool breeze on the deck and take in the cityscape. It’s a relaxing experience, though in hindsight, I might have chosen to visit another attraction instead. The fleeting glimpses of these sights from the boat didn’t leave a strong impression, and while Paris is indeed beautiful from the river, I found myself more curious about why the river’s flow was so fast than fully enjoying the cruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cuisine\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCuisine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Le-Petit-Cler\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Le-Petit-Cler.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first meal was at Le Petit Cler, where we tried duck confit and escargot—must-try dishes according to our pre-trip research. I don’t mind European cuisine, even though my taste might be considered simple, but I can see how it could be a bit unfamiliar for many Taiwanese people. Escargot tastes similar to large snails, with the key flavor coming from the sauce. The duck confit reminded us of chicken legs—we even questioned if we’d ordered the right dish—but I think it’s a flavor that would appeal to many in Taiwan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"L-Eclipse\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/L-Eclipse.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’Eclipse was a small restaurant near where we stayed, run by a very friendly owner who chatted with us every day. It’s also where we had the most memorable dish of the trip—a cheese platter. The reason we ordered it was because a French person I met on the plane highly recommended trying cheese in Paris, so we thought we’d give it a shot. I’d say everyone should try it at least once, not because it’s bad, but because having such a large quantity of cheese can be overwhelming for those of us who are used to just a single slice. But I must say, they really do have a wide variety of cheeses. By the way, this was also where we learned that in French restaurants, the bread served before the meal is free and can be refilled, much like how bread is treated as a staple food there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daily-summary\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaily Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParis has some interesting contrasts.

The glass pyramid exudes modern elegance, so much so that I bought a miniature version as a souvenir. Since we’re not particularly well-versed in art, we focused on visiting a few key exhibits—the museum’s three treasures: the Venus de Milo, the Mona Lisa, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"la-joconde\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLa Joconde\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"La-Joconde\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/La-Joconde.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we entered the Louvre, we headed straight for the Mona Lisa—it’s the only artwork we were familiar with before visiting. There’s a legend that no matter where you stand, the Mona Lisa’s eyes will follow you, and to my surprise, it’s true! It’s a strange sensation, as if the painting’s gaze meets yours no matter where you move. The painting exudes an aura of ambiguity—her smile, her expression, everything is deliberately vague. Even more astonishing is that this famous piece is an unfinished work. The legend of the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile truly lives up to its reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"victoire-de-samothrace\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVictoire de Samothrace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Victoire-de-Samothrace\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Victoire-de-Samothrace.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually passed by this statue on our way to the Mona Lisa without realizing it was one of the museum’s treasures. We later came back to admire it more closely. After seeing so many statues, you start to notice that despite all being sculptures, each one conveys a distinct artistic expression. Some are soft and gentle, while others are fierce or grand. The Winged Victory’s dynamic pose gives off a sense of power and conquest, as if she’s ready to take on the world. Even though her head is missing, the sheer force of her presence is undeniable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"vénus-de-milo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVénus de Milo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Vénus-de-Milo\" src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/V%C3%A9nus-de-Milo.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venus de Milo was already missing its arms when it was discovered, but unlike the powerful Winged Victory, this sculpture radiates a softer, more natural beauty.

I’m not great at describing food, so I’ll just share the two dishes that I found most memorable—the duck confit and raspberry cake. Duck confit is a signature French dish and a must-try, but this restaurant’s version was even more flavorful than the one we had earlier in the trip. The skin was crispy, and the meat was incredibly tender. As for the raspberry cake, I wasn’t initially interested, but after tasting it, I gained a new appreciation for the combination of berries and cakes. The raspberries were perfectly balanced—sweet with just the right amount of tartness to cut through the richness of the cake.

As part of the organizing team, our goal is to ensure the smooth running of the event while addressing past issues and introducing new innovations to make the event better every year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-mei-chu-hackathon-organizing-team\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Mei-Chu Hackathon Organizing Team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team consists of over 40 members, divided into seven departments: Administration, Public Relations, Marketing, Finance, Event Planning, Development, and Design. Each department is led by 2-3 heads and has 5-6 members under them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-i-chose-to-be-the-head-of-the-event-planning-department\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Chose to be the Head of the Event Planning Department\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mei-Chu Hackathon organizing team is highly selective, with an annual acceptance rate of only around 10%. In the first year, selected members join as team members, and in the second year, department heads are chosen from this pool. So essentially, we’ve had experience organizing two consecutive events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was initially drawn to the event because it aligns closely with my academic background, and I wanted to learn and grow within a well-structured team. The experience of organizing a large-scale event is invaluable to me. Prior to this, I had few opportunities to engage in public affairs. The Mei-Chu Hackathon covers a broad range of responsibilities: the team has over 40 members, there are over 300 participants, and we collaborate with dozens of partner and sponsor companies, with an annual budget approaching 2 million NTD. Being involved in an event of this scale and leading a department was a great growth opportunity for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"event-planning-department-responsibilities\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvent Planning Department Responsibilities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur department handles everything related to the venue and event process. Below are some of our key tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"venue-rental\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVenue Rental\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince our main audience consists of students from NCTU and NTHU, and because the event requires an overnight venue, we aimed to secure either NCTU or NTHU gymnasiums. This was a long process because neither gym allows overnight events. The schools require staff to be on-site during nighttime hours to ensure safety, which was a significant hurdle. Additionally, our setup times often clashed with team practices and PE classes, making scheduling a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"venue-setup\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVenue Setup\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the extensive equipment needed for the event, we partnered with \u0026ldquo;Activity King Group,\u0026rdquo; a company specializing in event logistics. They handled everything related to venue setup and equipment. The process involved six months of adjustments, covering details like table and chair arrangements, stage setup, sound and lighting systems, vendor booths, generator setups, power distribution, and internet access. These details were fine-tuned step by step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"meal-distribution\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeal Distribution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur department was also responsible for providing meals at the venue. Estimating the right amount of food was challenging; we had to account for potential shortages and sometimes had to place emergency orders if vendors didn’t deliver enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"detailed-event-schedule-planning\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetailed Event Schedule Planning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the most challenging aspect. The Event Planning Department had to ensure that every staff member knew their tasks at every point in time and understood where the event was in its schedule. We designed an efficient schedule, allocated manpower appropriately, and created a user-friendly format for everyone to follow. As the event drew closer, more details needed to be finalized, leading to sleepless nights in the final week as we worried about every aspect of the schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"entertainment-and-corporate-expo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEntertainment and Corporate Expo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis section was primarily handled by team members. One unique aspect of the Mei-Chu Hackathon is that, in addition to corporate booths, we have entertainment areas for participants, featuring different types of game machines each year. Past attractions included massage chairs, Logitech racing simulators, ball pits, and more. The Event Planning Department also designed prize draws and activities to encourage participants to visit corporate booths, often integrating these with a LINE bot for engaging challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-site-coordination\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn-Site Coordination\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final test for the Event Planning Department heads was managing on-site operations. No matter how detailed the schedule was, unexpected issues always arose on the day of the event. We had to ensure every team member was in the right place at the right time. On the day of the event, you’d see three of us constantly running around with earpieces, coordinating and troubleshooting. We faced a significant challenge when our Admin Lead tested positive for COVID-19 on the day, leaving us without a crucial team member. We had to scramble to fill that gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reflections-from-the-past-year\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReflections from the Past Year\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I want to express how fortunate we were to have a highly capable and creative administration team. They led us through the event planning process and solved many of the issues that plagued previous years. Large organizations often face management challenges, such as complex communication and document organization across departments. Without proper document categorization, version discrepancies and information gaps easily arise. This event showed us how even minor delays in one department’s tasks can cascade and affect other teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery department had its periods of intense pressure. For the Event Planning Department, stress peaked as the event date approached, when we had to handle numerous unexpected issues. I must admit, I’m not great with details, so I’m grateful to the other two department heads for their hard work and support during the preparation phase, which taught me a lot. When I was younger, large events seemed like a mystery to me—I never knew how things operated behind the scenes. Participating in this process opened my eyes; I learned about event workflows, venue setups, manpower allocation, and so much more. It’s an entirely different experience from merely attending an event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure on-site was intense since we were responsible for the entire event’s rhythm. We had to make quick decisions when delays occurred, ensure equipment and manpower were in place, and handle emergencies. One of the most dramatic incidents this year was when a participant experienced heart palpitations during the competition, and we had to call an ambulance to take them to the hospital, which shocked everyone. While we did our best to keep everything running smoothly, there were inevitably some gaps. One member kept complaining about issues we hadn’t addressed, which was disheartening since everyone was doing their best. Constructive feedback is welcome, but delivering it with frustration or anger creates unnecessary tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year has been incredibly rewarding. Beyond learning event management details, I met many capable people from different fields, people I wouldn’t have encountered within my usual circles. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone during college, whether by joining new activities or trying things you usually wouldn’t. I’m glad I seized this opportunity, which added fresh memories to my sophomore and junior years.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/10th-MeiChu-Hackathon.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/meichu-hackathon-event-planning-leader/","title":"Insights from Organizing the Mei-Chu Hackathon"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eDue to my role as an organizer for the Meichu Hackathon over the past two years, it was only natural for me to return and participate again.

Many elderly people often struggle to read small text, such as labels and instructions. To address this issue, we developed a text magnifier. Users can capture the text they need to read, and by using an image-to-text API, we can extract the text. We then use a large language model to reformat and present the information to the user. Additionally, users can ask questions about the text, such as: “What is the expiration date of this drink?” Our app, after processing the information, will provide the answer to help users retrieve the information they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"object-mode\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObject Mode\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"/images/posts/11th-meichu-hackathon/object-mode-introduction.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis feature is aimed at enabling visually impaired individuals to live independently. The goal is to help users locate items through image recognition. Users specify what item they are looking for, and based on the image recognition results, the app provides directional cues, such as \u0026ldquo;turn left\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;turn right,\u0026rdquo; to guide them to the item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"technical-architecture\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnical Architecture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"/images/posts/11th-meichu-hackathon/text-mode-technique.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Text Mode, we use ML Kit to convert images to text and then employ a large language model with designed prompts to integrate the data and answer user queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"/images/posts/11th-meichu-hackathon/object-mode-technique.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Object Mode, we use a lightweight Yolov5 model to determine object positions in images.

This topic was particularly challenging for us, as there is limited scope for innovation in \u0026ldquo;accessibility apps.\u0026rdquo; We considered many ideas, but struggled with two main issues: existing competition and the technical simplicity of our solutions, which didn’t favor the competition. The most challenging aspect of hackathons is not the implementation itself but coming up with a project that showcases both technical prowess and creativity while effectively addressing user pain points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us a long time to decide on a project, and by the time we started working, we had only five days left. The most daunting part was that none of the five team members had experience with Android app development, which was a significant challenge. Despite learning a new skill, this hackathon truly felt like a hackathon—requiring us to complete a project in a very short timeframe, making trade-offs between quality and completeness. Our team put in our best effort to prepare for this competition, and it was a fantastic experience for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving organized the event myself, I was very aware of all the details involved. Seeing the next generation of organizers under pressure was quite touching. Some participants may criticize the organizing team due to minor issues or lack of planning, but I believe constructive feedback is more valuable. The organizers work hard to make the event successful, and while there are always areas for improvement, harsh criticism is unnecessary. After a year of hard work, everyone deserves more understanding and helpful suggestions. This way, the event can continue to improve, and the world becomes a better place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/MeiChuHackathon.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/11th-meichu-hackathon/","title":"Insights from the 11th Meichu Hackathon"},{"content":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of p\u003csub\u003ei\u003c/sub\u003e , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"method-1-recursion\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMethod 1: Recursion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion.

You can create a new branch for this, ensuring the new feature doesn’t impact the main functionality.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor multi-person development, each person can manage their own branch and merge changes later, eliminating the need to copy and paste code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn academic research, you might need to experiment with different changes to see their impact. Branches allow you to control different functionalities without commenting out old code to run new features.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s essential to distinguish between local and remote in Github. Any changes made locally won’t affect the remote repository until they’re pushed. Communication should be clear about whether we’re discussing local commits, local branches, remote commits, or remote branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-shell=1\" data-lang=\"shell=1\"\u003egit branch\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003egit branch\u003c/code\u003e shows which branches exist and which branch you’re currently on locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-shell=1\" data-lang=\"shell=1\"\u003egit checkout [-b] \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003egit checkout\u003c/code\u003e switches to another branch locally.
