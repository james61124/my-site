[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland is undoubtedly one of the most expensive places in the world. I originally thought the Netherlands and the UK were already pricey, but the cost of living here feels almost 1.5 to 2 times higher than those areas. Despite this, Switzerland remains my favorite country so far. When I used to hear about Switzerland, a few keywords always came up – wealthy people, watches, the Alps, and stunning nature. This time, I finally got to experience it firsthand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe currency here is the Swiss Franc (Franc), which is roughly equivalent to the Euro but slightly more expensive, though not as costly as the British Pound. For transportation, we took a 10-hour Flixbus ride from Eindhoven to Basel, then hopped on a Swiss train to Bern. From there, we could start exploring. Over the past few days, Bern has been our main transit hub. We stayed in a small town near Bern, so every trip involved passing through Bern – heading out to explore and returning via Bern to our accommodation. If you’re under 25, you can get a Friends Day Ticket for 28 Francs, which lets you take most public transportation. It’s a great deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scenery here gets better each day – from small towns, lakes, and valleys to snow-capped mountains. As a sneak peek, my personal favorites were the lakes on day two and the snowy landscapes on day four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/start.jpg\" alt=\"start\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-1---bern\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 1 - Bern\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think Zurich was the capital of Switzerland, probably because it’s the only Swiss city I had heard of. However, Bern is actually the capital – a lively little town. The old town area is quite small, just one main street, which makes all the attractions close by and perfect for a half-day or one-day trip. It’s a good warm-up for the journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"clock-tower\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClock Tower\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Clock-Tower.JPG\" alt=\"Clock-Tower\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this clock tower marks the entrance to Bern’s old town. At first glance, it didn’t seem like much, so I later looked up some history about it. The clock tower is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Beyond telling time and displaying astronomical information, it has served as a city gate, prison, and watchtower. It still chimes near the top of each hour.

I’m not great at describing food, but I could tell they were delicious. The outer shell is hard chocolate, while the inside is soft and rich.

Due to limited time and budget, I skipped these. I don’t feel the need to check off every site in old towns like this.

Bern is essentially an old town, so if you’re short on time, I’d recommend prioritizing the natural scenery coming up in the following days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-2---interlaken\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 2 - Interlaken\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s main goal was to see the lakes and take a boat ride in Interlaken, so the itinerary was a bit scattered. Interlaken gets its name because it’s located between two lakes. The weather was amazing today – even the lakes I saw from the train were stunning. It might sound cliché to describe the water as shimmering, but that’s honestly the best way to put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"interlaken-west---intetlaken-ost\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterlaken West - Intetlaken Ost\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis route forms the main sightseeing path through Interlaken’s town area. While it doesn’t run directly along the lakes, it offers a great look at Swiss urban life.

We made a quick decision to head to Jungfraujoch instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting there was straightforward. I took public transport to Grindelwald Terminal, where I purchased a return ticket to Jungfraujoch. The ticket machine was easy to navigate. The journey involved taking a cable car from Grindelwald Terminal to Eigergletscher, followed by a train to Jungfraujoch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, Jungfraujoch is extremely expensive. A round trip ticket cost 200 Francs, which was painful. Friends\u0026rsquo; day tickets no longer covered the route past Grindelwald Terminal. Most people use half-fare cards (50% off) or Swiss Passes (25% off) to reduce the cost. Despite the price, it was totally worth it. Jungfraujoch only has about 80 clear days a year, and who knows how many times I\u0026rsquo;ll visit Switzerland in my lifetime. With the perfect weather and a sea of clouds beneath the peak, I knew I would regret not going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"grindwald-terminal\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrindwald Terminal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OvC_zgx0Bs\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"height: 15px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the mountain view next to Grindwald Terminal.

The vastness of the world is beyond imagination. In the cable car, you feel surrounded by mountains, standing at a high vantage point overlooking the entire valley – it’s breathtaking. The cable cars here are very different from the ones in Taiwan. Not only are the cabins large enough to hold over 20 people, but the floor-to-ceiling windows allow for an even broader view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/Jungfraujoch-5.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfraujoch\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the view just before reaching the clouds.

I initially thought wearing sneakers to climb a snowy mountain would be inconvenient, but it wasn’t too bad. I expected my shoes to get wet, but the walkable areas had been hardened by other visitors, so my shoes didn’t get wet.

I guess I was lucky – since it was the off-season and near closing time, there weren’t many people, and I got my photo quickly. The biggest challenge wasn’t the crowd but the wind. Since the slope is slightly inclined and my shoes had no grip, I struggled to stay steady on the windy summit.

However, if you ask whether it offers the best value for money, I’m not so sure – it’s incredibly expensive and does feel a bit overly commercialized. But you never know how many chances you’ll have to visit Switzerland in your lifetime. Sometimes, getting “ripped off” to see world-class scenery feels worth it. What moved me the most was that, for the first three days, I kept seeing ads for the \u0026ldquo;Top of Europe\u0026rdquo; everywhere, and on the last day, I was actually standing there. It still felt unreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland was much more beautiful than I had imagined. Maybe the great weather acted as a filter, but seeing the Alps and lakes described in textbooks, feeling the wealthy atmosphere, and noticing that even the elderly and children on the trains were reading books instead of looking at their phones – it was all very refreshing. The world is vast, and being able to take this trip during my brief stay in Europe made it all feel worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrip Date : 20240914 - 20240917\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/travel/Switzerland-20240914/scenary.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/travel/Switzerland-20240914/","title":"Switzerland Free Travel | 4-Day Immersive Journey into the Alpine Wonderland – From Lakes to Snowy Peaks"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eLondon is a city I might have known about since I was three years old, but I had never been there.

I believe it’s a musical everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit of preparation advice: ticket prices vary greatly, sometimes by dozens of euros for just a few rows\u0026rsquo; difference. The view really does change depending on the seat. Since I bought tickets in advance, they were quite expensive, but you can grab cheaper day tickets if you line up on the day of the performance. The theater itself isn’t very large, but sitting closer lets you clearly see the iconic chandelier fall scene. Otherwise, parts of it might be blocked by the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure to review the plot in detail before watching. Although the performance is in English, some of the vocabulary is difficult (or maybe my English just isn’t great). Since it’s sung, I felt like they could have been singing in Italian, and I wouldn’t have known the difference. I could catch a few key words, but I had forgotten most of the plot by the time Act 1 started, so I was a bit lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/London-20240906/The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera.jpg\" alt=\"The-Phantom-Of-The-Opera\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s so much I want to say, but it’s hard to express in words. A great musical surprises you with its script, stage design, and music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of music – I took an orchestration class before, so I have some basic knowledge of orchestral arrangements (though I can’t compose at all). I was amazed by the musical techniques and found many parts inspiring. Sometimes, multiple characters sing at once. There are counterpoints, harmonies, and choral arrangements happening simultaneously. The layers of vocals alone are complex enough, but the instrumental arrangements behind them are even more fascinating. The sound quality was so good that I could hear every melodic line distinctly, as well as the interplay between instruments. The harmonies were especially striking – many parts were dissonant, reflecting the suspense and anger in the plot. It reminded me of random, chaotic sounds I’d make by slamming piano keys, yet it perfectly conveyed the eerie atmosphere. The composers are truly incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most iconic piece is undoubtedly the musical’s theme song. The moment you hear it, you know it’s The Phantom of the Opera. The repeated chromatic scales, the key changes, and the male lead’s intense singing evoke a mix of tension, anger, and sorrow. This melody recurs throughout the show, but each time, it’s arranged and sung differently to match the mood, which I found brilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding stage design – even though I couldn’t fully understand the dialogue, many of the visual elements on stage were eye-catching. Some scenes could have been mundane, but the production elevated them to iconic moments. For example, in Act 2, when the male lead is assassinated and replaced by the Phantom, the chaos is portrayed by rushing a stretcher with a covered body across the stage. If I were designing it, I might have added an entire scene to show the assassination directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother scene that stood out to me was the contrast between the happy couple and the Phantom’s pain. In one part, the Phantom stands at the front of the stage, singing in anguish, while the couple’s joyful voices echo from behind. In another scene, the Phantom remains on stage, while the background splits open to reveal the couple rowing a boat – a task that should have been the Phantom’s. This visual parallel and emotional contrast were stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part was near the end when the female lead kisses the Phantom – not out of love, but to save the male lead. The Phantom, heartbroken by the realization that she doesn’t truly love him, lets them go. His anguished cry of \u0026ldquo;Go away!\u0026rdquo; as he releases them, leaving himself alone, was utterly gut-wrenching. The epic music at that moment shattered me emotionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main itinerary for the second day was to see Taylor’s last day of the exhibition in London, followed by a visit to the legendary London Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"va-museum\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eV\u0026amp;A Museum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/London-20240906/V\u0026amp;A.jpg\" alt=\"V\u0026amp;A\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor’s exhibition was held here this time, and it was free.

There were also special exhibitions and IMAX screenings, but all of them required tickets. The free sections mainly featured various exhibitions — we saw displays about rockets and energy, though they weren’t of great interest to us. So, we left early and headed for Tower Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScience Museum Location：\u003ca href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5UMqp2ZjU4q2aUka6\"\u003ehttps://maps.app.goo.gl/5UMqp2ZjU4q2aUka6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"tower-bridge\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTower Bridge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/London-20240906/Tower-Bridge.jpg\" alt=\"Tower-Bridge\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTower Bridge is one of those landmarks even kindergarteners recognize, so we had to check it out.

There’s a website that lets you check the opening times for the day. Basically, traffic stops on the bridge, the bridge opens to let ships pass, and then closes again. The schedule varies daily, and it doesn’t necessarily open every day. The official site where you can check the lifting times is linked below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing you absolutely can’t miss is Tower Bridge at night. The night view is stunning — the entire bridge and the surrounding path light up. It’s perfect for a riverside walk or a quiet dinner. The riverside path is wider and livelier than the one near the London Eye. There are also small attractions and restaurants nearby.

Sleeping at the airport seemed like the better option. I thought it would be strange, but the airport was surprisingly lively — everyone was sleeping there. There were seating areas, food, and some people even brought mats to sleep on. I didn’t bring one, so I chose to rest with my head on the table. Lying directly on the ground seemed too cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I really want to share is that even if you sleep at the airport, don’t wait too long to go through security. My Ryanair flight closed the gate 30 minutes before departure. I thought getting to security half an hour before the gate closed would be fine — once I passed, I could head to the gate, right? Wrong. Security was packed, and I almost missed my flight. To make matters worse, my bag was flagged for a second check. By the time I cleared security, I had maybe three minutes left before the gate closed. Luckily, there was no passport check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this airport is huge — Gate 90-something felt like it was miles away. I sprinted through the airport, panic rising as I couldn’t even see the boarding gate. Fortunately, I just barely made it. If I had missed the flight, it would have been a costly mistake, possibly forcing me to stay another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, I found out you can actually go through security the night before, as long as you do it before security closes. Then, you can sleep at any gate you like. This way, you won’t have to worry about rushing through security in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK has some peculiar aspects. The weather isn’t great — every day we were there was foggy, and when it drizzled, no one used an umbrella. It seems people are just used to it. Unless it’s pouring, it’s not considered rain to them. Also, the internet situation here is bizarre. Sometimes, stepping into a restaurant means losing all signal, not even a single bar. But once you finish eating, the signal returns, or sometimes it cuts out randomly while walking. It’s very different from Taiwan, where you can get signal almost everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBritish food isn’t something I particularly miss, which is why I didn’t write much about it. We just grabbed whatever was convenient. Prices weren’t cheap, and the food wasn’t extraordinary. But we were mainly here to soak in the atmosphere, so it didn’t really matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funniest part was the bus schedule — it felt completely fake. A bus ride to Big Ben that was supposed to take 30 minutes ended up crawling through traffic the entire way. I honestly have no idea how they estimate those schedules! Another thing is that the cost of living feels high, possibly because the pound is stronger than the euro. Prices in absolute terms seem similar to other parts of Europe, but when you convert it to pounds, it’s effectively more expensive. For example, a meal priced at 12 euros versus 12 pounds is a noticeable difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, I don’t dislike the UK. In fact, I found it fascinating. The streets of London are charming, and I don’t know if it’s because of Harry Potter, but the city feels like stepping into a magical world. The Gothic architecture and spires, some of which are over a hundred years old, add to the allure. Part of why I like it might be because many of the books and movies I loved as a kid — like Conan, Arsène Lupin, and Sherlock Holmes — are set here. There’s just this inexplicable draw to London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like London has so many more places to explore, and it’s definitely a city I’d like to revisit in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/travel/London-20240906/Tower-Bridge-Night.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/travel/London-20240906/","title":"England - Two Days in London 20240906"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"day-1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took a Flixbus overnight from Eindhoven to Munich, a trip that took more than 10 hours. Besides being cheap, there aren’t many perks to this kind of journey—sleeping upright in a seat and not being able to stretch your legs is tough, and then having to start exploring right after arriving is even tougher.

Honestly though, I nearly gave up even with the Chinese guide because I know so little about history! One of the things that stood out was how much of the palace was destroyed during WWII, which is unfortunate. Many of the rooms have been reconstructed, so they don’t look as extravagant as I had imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne room that really impressed me featured a trick of perspective—a fresco that makes the ceiling look much higher than it really is, depending on where you stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/travel/Munich-20240823/Residenz-Munchen-2.jpg\" alt=\"Residenz-Munchen-2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at all that gold!

The challenges in university are worth attempting because the consequences of failure at this stage are usually not too severe.

Despite not having a proper conclusion to the year, looking back, I’m grateful for the many memorable experiences—meeting amazing people, organizing performances, and working to improve the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reflections-on-my-leadership-experience\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReflections on My Leadership Experience\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading a team is truly an area where you constantly learn. Throughout the year, I found myself swinging between various choices and compromises. The most important lesson I learned is that it’s impossible to make decisions that satisfy everyone. I once heard a quote I really like: “A good decision-maker is someone who can make the best and quickest decisions.” This may sound like a cliché, but it highlights a real dilemma. The reason you can’t make a quick decision is often because it seems like no matter what you choose, someone or something will be affected. You need to understand what’s most important for your team and learn to prioritize by sacrificing less critical aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflecting on my performance throughout the year, I feel that my decisions were too “soft.” Being “soft” means that while maintaining event quality, you inevitably sacrifice your own time and that of the officers. Good event quality requires extensive preparation. NCTU isn’t a university known for strong club culture since it’s more academically focused. Motivating the team to make sacrifices for club activities was a significant challenge. I couldn’t guarantee success in their academic lives, so I hesitated to push them too hard, which led to two outcomes: a slight compromise in event quality and burning myself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the perspective of a leader, it’s crucial to see the bigger picture and effectively use available resources. I think a fitting way to describe it is: “You don’t need to complete every task yourself, but you must ensure that every task is completed.” This is a different mindset from that of a regular officer, who only needs to complete assigned tasks. A leader must ensure that once tasks are delegated, the event can proceed smoothly. Can they complete the tasks? If unexpected issues arise, are there backup plans? To address these questions, you need to invest more effort in thinking through the details. This brings us to another balancing act: deciding which details are worth focusing on and which are not. If you focus on every detail, meetings become extremely long. But if you delegate and let go entirely, something is bound to go wrong. It’s essential to ensure that meetings efficiently cover the key points while each team tracks their progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, my sophomore year brought significant changes to my life. I used to focus only on matters directly related to me, but my experience in the club taught me to see the world from a broader perspective. It also instilled in me the pressure of responsibility. Therefore, I believe that during university, it’s essential to pursue learning not only through academic achievements but also by gaining other important values from different experiences that broaden your horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/GuitarClub.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/guitar-club/","title":"NCTU Guitar Club Experience"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"project-overview\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProject Overview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe designed a system called \u0026ldquo;Dida Dream - Timely Assistance System,\u0026rdquo; aiming to achieve food redistribution by integrating a platform for near-expiry products with an online donation channel.

Standing in a foreign city, surrounded by an unfamiliar environment and language, the word \u0026ldquo;unknown\u0026rdquo; defined our entire journey. No matter how well-prepared we were, exploring a new country and culture always brings unexpected surprises and insights. The main takeaway from this trip was experiencing these cities firsthand, not just for the attractions, but also for their overall atmosphere and culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"arc-de-triomphe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArc de Triomphe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Arc-de-Triomphe-2.jpg\" alt=\"Arc-de-Triomphe\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arc de Triomphe was even more imposing than it looks in photos, especially with its commanding presence at the center of a massive roundabout. Climbing the 200 steps to the top offers a stunning view of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower as a breathtaking backdrop. The Arc is at the hub of 12 radiating roads, and because we visited during rush hour, the roundabout was completely clogged with traffic, disrupting the flow of all the connecting avenues. Standing at the top, we could hear endless honking, and the sheer scale of the traffic jam was oddly impressive, reflecting the frustration of those stuck in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"seine-river\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeine River\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Seine-River.jpg\" alt=\"Seine-River\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople often say the Seine is a romantic river, and a river cruise is a must-do activity. The cruise offers views of many famous Paris landmarks while you enjoy the cool breeze on the deck and take in the cityscape. It’s a relaxing experience, though in hindsight, I might have chosen to visit another attraction instead. The fleeting glimpses of these sights from the boat didn’t leave a strong impression, and while Paris is indeed beautiful from the river, I found myself more curious about why the river’s flow was so fast than fully enjoying the cruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cuisine\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCuisine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Le-Petit-Cler.jpg\" alt=\"Le-Petit-Cler\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first meal was at Le Petit Cler, where we tried duck confit and escargot—must-try dishes according to our pre-trip research. I don’t mind European cuisine, even though my taste might be considered simple, but I can see how it could be a bit unfamiliar for many Taiwanese people. Escargot tastes similar to large snails, with the key flavor coming from the sauce. The duck confit reminded us of chicken legs—we even questioned if we’d ordered the right dish—but I think it’s a flavor that would appeal to many in Taiwan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/L-Eclipse.jpg\" alt=\"L-Eclipse\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’Eclipse was a small restaurant near where we stayed, run by a very friendly owner who chatted with us every day. It’s also where we had the most memorable dish of the trip—a cheese platter. The reason we ordered it was because a French person I met on the plane highly recommended trying cheese in Paris, so we thought we’d give it a shot. I’d say everyone should try it at least once, not because it’s bad, but because having such a large quantity of cheese can be overwhelming for those of us who are used to just a single slice. But I must say, they really do have a wide variety of cheeses. By the way, this was also where we learned that in French restaurants, the bread served before the meal is free and can be refilled, much like how bread is treated as a staple food there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daily-summary\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaily Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParis has some interesting contrasts. While the metro is a bit outdated, the streets are very clean, with trash bins frequently available but never overflowing. Every waiter hums a tune while taking orders, radiating positive energy. It feels like they truly enjoy their work, seamlessly blending life with their jobs. On the other hand, no one seems to care much about pedestrian lights, and seeing mice in restaurants seems to be a common sight that doesn’t bother anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sainte-chapelle\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSainte Chapelle\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Sainte-Chapelle.jpg\" alt=\"Sainte-Chapelle\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highlight of Sainte Chapelle is its massive rose window and 15 stained-glass panels, each depicting different biblical stories in 1,113 individual sections. Although I’m not a Christian and didn’t understand most of the stories, the grandeur is undeniable. Each small piece of glass tells an independent story, and together they form an immersive Christian world—a sweeping narrative that unfolds before you as you take it all in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"la-conciergerie\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLa Conciergerie\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/La-Conciergerie.jpg\" alt=\"La-Conciergerie\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa Conciergerie is a smaller attraction, once a prison that held over 2,600 people.

However, the free AR guide more than makes up for it, showing what the rooms once looked like and how they were used. This visual storytelling, complete with well-designed animations, transformed the visit from a bland walkthrough into a highly engaging experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"musée-du-louvre\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusée du Louvre\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Mus%C3%A9e-du-Louvre.jpg\" alt=\"Musée-du-Louvre\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Louvre was one of the main highlights of our trip to France, and I had been eagerly anticipating it. The glass pyramid exudes modern elegance, so much so that I bought a miniature version as a souvenir. Since we’re not particularly well-versed in art, we focused on visiting a few key exhibits—the museum’s three treasures: the Venus de Milo, the Mona Lisa, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"la-joconde\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLa Joconde\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/La-Joconde.jpg\" alt=\"La-Joconde\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we entered the Louvre, we headed straight for the Mona Lisa—it’s the only artwork we were familiar with before visiting. There’s a legend that no matter where you stand, the Mona Lisa’s eyes will follow you, and to my surprise, it’s true! It’s a strange sensation, as if the painting’s gaze meets yours no matter where you move. The painting exudes an aura of ambiguity—her smile, her expression, everything is deliberately vague. Even more astonishing is that this famous piece is an unfinished work. The legend of the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile truly lives up to its reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"victoire-de-samothrace\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVictoire de Samothrace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/Victoire-de-Samothrace.jpg\" alt=\"Victoire-de-Samothrace\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually passed by this statue on our way to the Mona Lisa without realizing it was one of the museum’s treasures. We later came back to admire it more closely. After seeing so many statues, you start to notice that despite all being sculptures, each one conveys a distinct artistic expression. Some are soft and gentle, while others are fierce or grand. The Winged Victory’s dynamic pose gives off a sense of power and conquest, as if she’s ready to take on the world. Even though her head is missing, the sheer force of her presence is undeniable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"vénus-de-milo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVénus de Milo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/V%C3%A9nus-de-Milo.jpg\" alt=\"Vénus-de-Milo\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venus de Milo was already missing its arms when it was discovered, but unlike the powerful Winged Victory, this sculpture radiates a softer, more natural beauty. The missing arms contribute to what’s known as “the beauty of imperfection,” which is one of the reasons for her fame. Her slightly raised left foot supports her slipping garment, while the artist’s skillful rendering of her body lines creates a sense of elegance and grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cuisine-1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCuisine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/confit-de-canard.jpg\" alt=\"confit-de-canard\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/paris-20240125/framboise.jpg\" alt=\"framboise\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa Jacobine was the best restaurant we dined at in France, but it was also the most expensive. We ordered a full three-course meal with an appetizer, main course, and dessert. I’m not great at describing food, so I’ll just share the two dishes that I found most memorable—the duck confit and raspberry cake. Duck confit is a signature French dish and a must-try, but this restaurant’s version was even more flavorful than the one we had earlier in the trip. The skin was crispy, and the meat was incredibly tender. As for the raspberry cake, I wasn’t initially interested, but after tasting it, I gained a new appreciation for the combination of berries and cakes. The raspberries were perfectly balanced—sweet with just the right amount of tartness to cut through the richness of the cake. It was definitely a highlight worth mentioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daily-summary-1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaily Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though we only spent two days in Paris, it’s definitely a city I’d love to revisit.

Below are some of our key tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"venue-rental\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVenue Rental\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince our main audience consists of students from NCTU and NTHU, and because the event requires an overnight venue, we aimed to secure either NCTU or NTHU gymnasiums. This was a long process because neither gym allows overnight events. The schools require staff to be on-site during nighttime hours to ensure safety, which was a significant hurdle. Additionally, our setup times often clashed with team practices and PE classes, making scheduling a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"venue-setup\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVenue Setup\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the extensive equipment needed for the event, we partnered with \u0026ldquo;Activity King Group,\u0026rdquo; a company specializing in event logistics. They handled everything related to venue setup and equipment. The process involved six months of adjustments, covering details like table and chair arrangements, stage setup, sound and lighting systems, vendor booths, generator setups, power distribution, and internet access. These details were fine-tuned step by step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"meal-distribution\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeal Distribution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur department was also responsible for providing meals at the venue. Estimating the right amount of food was challenging; we had to account for potential shortages and sometimes had to place emergency orders if vendors didn’t deliver enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"detailed-event-schedule-planning\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetailed Event Schedule Planning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the most challenging aspect. The Event Planning Department had to ensure that every staff member knew their tasks at every point in time and understood where the event was in its schedule. We designed an efficient schedule, allocated manpower appropriately, and created a user-friendly format for everyone to follow. As the event drew closer, more details needed to be finalized, leading to sleepless nights in the final week as we worried about every aspect of the schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"entertainment-and-corporate-expo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEntertainment and Corporate Expo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis section was primarily handled by team members. One unique aspect of the Mei-Chu Hackathon is that, in addition to corporate booths, we have entertainment areas for participants, featuring different types of game machines each year. Past attractions included massage chairs, Logitech racing simulators, ball pits, and more. The Event Planning Department also designed prize draws and activities to encourage participants to visit corporate booths, often integrating these with a LINE bot for engaging challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-site-coordination\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn-Site Coordination\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final test for the Event Planning Department heads was managing on-site operations. No matter how detailed the schedule was, unexpected issues always arose on the day of the event. We had to ensure every team member was in the right place at the right time. On the day of the event, you’d see three of us constantly running around with earpieces, coordinating and troubleshooting. We faced a significant challenge when our Admin Lead tested positive for COVID-19 on the day, leaving us without a crucial team member. We had to scramble to fill that gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reflections-from-the-past-year\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReflections from the Past Year\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I want to express how fortunate we were to have a highly capable and creative administration team. They led us through the event planning process and solved many of the issues that plagued previous years. Large organizations often face management challenges, such as complex communication and document organization across departments. Without proper document categorization, version discrepancies and information gaps easily arise. This event showed us how even minor delays in one department’s tasks can cascade and affect other teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery department had its periods of intense pressure. For the Event Planning Department, stress peaked as the event date approached, when we had to handle numerous unexpected issues. I must admit, I’m not great with details, so I’m grateful to the other two department heads for their hard work and support during the preparation phase, which taught me a lot. When I was younger, large events seemed like a mystery to me—I never knew how things operated behind the scenes. Participating in this process opened my eyes; I learned about event workflows, venue setups, manpower allocation, and so much more. It’s an entirely different experience from merely attending an event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure on-site was intense since we were responsible for the entire event’s rhythm. We had to make quick decisions when delays occurred, ensure equipment and manpower were in place, and handle emergencies. One of the most dramatic incidents this year was when a participant experienced heart palpitations during the competition, and we had to call an ambulance to take them to the hospital, which shocked everyone. While we did our best to keep everything running smoothly, there were inevitably some gaps. One member kept complaining about issues we hadn’t addressed, which was disheartening since everyone was doing their best. Constructive feedback is welcome, but delivering it with frustration or anger creates unnecessary tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year has been incredibly rewarding. Beyond learning event management details, I met many capable people from different fields, people I wouldn’t have encountered within my usual circles. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone during college, whether by joining new activities or trying things you usually wouldn’t. I’m glad I seized this opportunity, which added fresh memories to my sophomore and junior years.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/10th-MeiChu-Hackathon.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/meichu-hackathon-event-planning-leader/","title":"Insights from Organizing the Mei-Chu Hackathon"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eDue to my role as an organizer for the Meichu Hackathon over the past two years, it was only natural for me to return and participate again.

Many elderly people often struggle to read small text, such as labels and instructions. To address this issue, we developed a text magnifier. Users can capture the text they need to read, and by using an image-to-text API, we can extract the text. We then use a large language model to reformat and present the information to the user. Additionally, users can ask questions about the text, such as: “What is the expiration date of this drink?” Our app, after processing the information, will provide the answer to help users retrieve the information they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"object-mode\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObject Mode\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/posts/11th-meichu-hackathon/object-mode-introduction.png\" alt=\"image\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis feature is aimed at enabling visually impaired individuals to live independently. The goal is to help users locate items through image recognition.

This topic was particularly challenging for us, as there is limited scope for innovation in \u0026ldquo;accessibility apps.\u0026rdquo; We considered many ideas, but struggled with two main issues: existing competition and the technical simplicity of our solutions, which didn’t favor the competition. The most challenging aspect of hackathons is not the implementation itself but coming up with a project that showcases both technical prowess and creativity while effectively addressing user pain points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us a long time to decide on a project, and by the time we started working, we had only five days left. The most daunting part was that none of the five team members had experience with Android app development, which was a significant challenge. Despite learning a new skill, this hackathon truly felt like a hackathon—requiring us to complete a project in a very short timeframe, making trade-offs between quality and completeness. Our team put in our best effort to prepare for this competition, and it was a fantastic experience for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving organized the event myself, I was very aware of all the details involved. Seeing the next generation of organizers under pressure was quite touching. Some participants may criticize the organizing team due to minor issues or lack of planning, but I believe constructive feedback is more valuable. The organizers work hard to make the event successful, and while there are always areas for improvement, harsh criticism is unnecessary. After a year of hard work, everyone deserves more understanding and helpful suggestions. This way, the event can continue to improve, and the world becomes a better place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/MeiChuHackathon.jpg","permalink":"https://jamesblogger.com/life/11th-meichu-hackathon/","title":"Insights from the 11th Meichu Hackathon"},{"content":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that selling a rod of length i yields a profit of p\u003csub\u003ei\u003c/sub\u003e , how do we cut a rod of length n to maximize the total revenue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"method-1-recursion\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMethod 1: Recursion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most straightforward approach is to solve it using recursion.
